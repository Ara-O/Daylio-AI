    Entry: Watched Narnia today and it was pretty good! I'm like full swing into daylio ai and honestly I might be able to finish it tomorrow??? Like bruh projects used to take so much longer, but granted this one is much smaller but could also be so cool! I'd love to finish it and talk to myself lol, I'm exciteddddd. I also watched Narnia ! And it was pretty good, then I played factorio, which was cool, not for as long as before too. Made lentils which were good as always, but also as always gotta keep learning how to manage sodium, gotta look more into the DASH thingamajig. ..Also worked some on mimic, mostly on code, tryin to run things on sarwars computer was being a pain so decided not to and Mike is gonna help me turn on the computer tomorrow thank God. ..What else, that's honestly about it, fairly productive day, had great conversations with mantas and pise, like we were reminiscing and stuff, it's already been 2 years!!! Which to me is wild. I alsonfeel like my face is almost always scrounged up somehow so I'm like slowly trying to make it more normal and chill, it's weird idk when I started doing that

    Entry: Okay first half of today was sweet, latter half, was okay, like a 5/10, I had my meeting with Dr Nafea - sarwar couldn't make it but we mainly talked about phds vs industry and I think I've made my mind but Im going to do more research, he for me more time to think. ..What else, oh, my main, bummer? Well I games for  a lot longer than I thought I would? I enjoyed and enjoy factorio, it was mainly asgards wrath that was just okay, not too enjoyable not bad but like, it's Ight. Didn't even do anything on MIMIC which I take full responsibility for. I did check off a small project in my list which was a bust. Also started another android based one which honestly has potential and I'm torn between finishing it and just letting it go, since I don't like, gain anything? After deliberation and fairly overthinking what project I want to work on, my main gripe is that I wanted to work on something COOL, and they all just seemed meh. I settled on the daylio ai After deciding that I'm not going to get paralysis by analysis and honestly it's still something I want to build! And it'll be cool to talk with myself so we'll see how it goes. Now I'm hype for it and think it would be cool! I think if I want to just waste time, I can finish Don't scroll, but I want to focus on something thatll build my skills...I'm still takin the python course and even though I am iffed about having to go through the basics of python, I KNOW how needed it is so I'm shutting up and locking in to learn about stuff like dictionaries, tuples etc. gotta check if orieakose is on campus too, in that case he could help me turn on the computer before Mike can. ..Him calling me and Eddie reposting and commenting was honestly one of the highlights of my day and probably week. ..I didn't eat a lot today and the back of my mind is constantly like, don't develop an eating disorderrr etc etc, which I guess it is right, and I'm trying to figure out a good balance, because like, I ate in a way that I was fairly satisfied all day, not too hungry, but I don't know if I'm not getting any calories in. So what I'm gonna do tomorrow is measure what I'm eating so I can be more conscious and get a geneeal guide. Like I'm gonna do lentils for sure with rice. And throw in some mixed vegs somewhere there. I really wanna shoot for 200 pounds and then continue from there cause I'm feeling.myself to be too like, heavy? Which doesn't make sense.but like, for health, I feel like it's been getting worse, josephene.just texted lol, I've been thinking of texting her to recommend mars red but idk if it's weird!!! ..Anyways anyways, yeah things like my hand falling asleep if I sleep on it has NEVER happened before, and just getting like my heart pumping from little physical activity has got me reevaluatig my goals. Same with the blood pressure thing! I'm starting.to monitor sodium, and limiting my mum's cooking especially for fried and jollof Rice is probbly where to start. Looking at the sodium in things like barbecue sauce was a shocker, so I have to keep my eyes open for that. Also should most likely find a healthy way to snack,  it's gonna be something I'll look more into as the only ideas I have right now are walnuts, and the almonds and maybe.carrots, so we'll see. I've been doing fairly well on limiting white bread and pepper to an extent, but yeah I'm taking my heart and weight more seriously now and I think often refocusing on that is gonna help me stick more to it. ..Recently, Ive been getting more and more of an urge to just like, be done with stuff, go to the work force, start making my own money and bein.independent and honestly idk how long that'd last, but in the past few months I've picked up good habits! Like taking care of my skin - technically just my face, my hair, brushing my teeth consistently! Developing a solid routine for all those has really helped me, also improving my fashion and dressing! All pretty helpful , but I've also regressed on things like faith and my walk with God and sin, so I can just be all talk but I'm going to bring back starting my day with the Bible. Starting tomorrow! Let's stick with it this time. ..Alzo reducing the short form content I consume is going.to be very important! I'm taking active steps to stop it whenever I find myself, not so much spiraling, moreso just, doom scrolling and not feeling very good about myself. Also gotta lock in on sleep. I've been getting a lot more headaches lately and I think the bonnets are one of the causes but idk, they're not accompanied by anything so I think it's also how I'm holding tension in my jaws, idk, but gonna.try to monitor that, cause I have a headache right.jnow lol ..Oof I just like bit one tooth with another and it hurt, can.replicate it, whatever 🥹, nope, found it, ugh that's a pain, I hope it's nothing,..Okay long unplanned.ish entry, Gonna go sleep now, goosnight

    Entry: I POSTED TO LINKEDIN YO, AND It's, going well?! Like, not well, I have like 5 likes, but Eddie reposted! I love Eddie, he's a G!! And orieakose called me out of the blue and congratulated me and was like, yo I got some tips, idk why I'm talking like this but I'm really happy that he did cause he is the one that motivated me, even pise motivated me, so like, Im pretty excited and happy, and I'm wishing I posted more of my.projects now but I have OMG I FORGOT TO RESPOND TO TEHANI LOL, doing that now, even had a meeting with Dr Nafea and didn't get cooked, so yeah doing great. Watching python course now...OH ALSO I GOT A FREAKING 95 ON NETWORKING FINAL??? LIKE THANK GOD SHEESH LOUISSE . Yeah that's my current state of mine. Gonna respond to tehani, and finish python section, then play factorio or vr

    My mood Motivated
    
    Entry: I got a surge of motivation tonight to lock in and I'm gonna.keep it moving, develop myself online, work hard on research, I have nothing but free time so let's go! ..Rita said shes in the hospital and hasn't responded as to why. I had a few things I wanted to say, one thing is my ego is getting out of whack and when I catch myself like, thinking of scenarios that Cater to my ego,.like, getting much higher than everyone else on an exam , then I'm like, wow I need something to humble me or reduce my ego. Then suddenly I'm like, bruh why? Like, it's good that I'm catching myself in those moments, but if I can't control my own sense of self worth then I'm just gonna be relying on everything else but me. And I'm realizing this again, especially when I feel like I start relying too much on online relationships and I'm less content with being alone. I remember having a similar conversation to this and I had to take some time to learn to be comfortable by myself again, so I think the same thing is going to happen here. Gonna turn off my notifs, or like limit it? We will see and I'll adjust myself and my actions accordingly, but the crux of it is that I gotta be able to be enough? ..Also faith, gotta lock in on faith. So I'm gonna make my first LinkedIn post tomorrow. Wish me luck, it's something I didn't realize scared me as much as it did you know, putting myself out there, and it feels terrifying, and I feel like I'll regret it, but then again I'll never know unless I work towards it! And if I regret it, it's a decision I made, not out of fear, but drive(?)..Spotify just started playing randomly???? Def hacked 😭..But yeah, I'm also gonna lock in on mimic research, no more excuses hehe, kinda hyped but I also know it's not gonna be a walk in the park at all. Meeting with Dr nafea tomorrow too. Gonna go to bed now, we lock in!!!

    Entry: I gotta delete Instagram, or like, do something else with my free time cause I spent so much on it, and not in a good way, just made me, feel worse? Not necessarily feel worse, but feel worse :*) so yeah we limiting our use. .Had coding club call and it went pretty well. Still waiting for all the grades to be put in, a bit nerve-wracking but I'll blink and it'd be Tuesday and all the conversations that need to be had would've been hadded, and the semester will fade into the background. I played a bunch a factorio, beat saber and even cards and tankards which is a rarity! Now gonna go to bed, I had a pretty cool dream with like us solving puzzles and stuff, it was sweet. Didn't resist temptation, haven't been close to my faith, not nearly. that's gonna change, yeah, ugh it's late and I'm tired of having bursts of motivation right before bed, what I need is discipline to actually push through. ..Also gotta get back on track with the cut!

    Entry: Have a headache now but it's going lower, idk if not moving just gives me a headache?? But whatever, pretty good day so far, on campus rn, went to workout and it was a pretty good workout but idk, my body feels a lot more like, fragile? Maybe I'm just more cognizant or attuned to it, but it sucks but I also haven't worked out in a good while so I suppose that's expected . Played factorio for like 2 hours in the secret room, which is where we'll be watching arcane, but then I remembered Dr nafeas work 🥲, so we are getting on that now. We also had our meeting with Dean snyder and it was so cool to see her really enjoy the site, I gotta transfer the feedback but I'm still really happy about it

Rewatched the arcane episode and it's so good 🫠🫠..We also got Chinese food and I got my CRAB RANGOONEYS, good as ever, listening to ishas theme from the arcane soundtrack before doing my skincare routine. Today was a pretty chill day tbh, I watched a murder mystery that was pretty good, it was onion something. Even watched a few episodes of money heist, in Spanish entirely! I'm.trhing to be more active in my learning and retention of Spanish, it also snowed!

    Entry: Cut is going well, well in the sense that I'm on campus without swipes most of the time so all I get is breakfast and dinner and maybe a snack here or there 😭😭, muscle loss here we go, I did cardio today but can't wait to get back into the swing of training. Image processing final came and went, may have gotten cooked but now it's out of sight out of mind out of EVERYTHING CAUSE I'm not thinking more about it, twas a fun class tho...Ay, this mariachi band music is stuck in my head, and it's really good, it's like DICEN que el amor sincero puede hacerte muy feliz. I'm trying to fill my Instagram with Spanish and it's honestly working out pretty well. ACTUALY, bigger news, I told Ethan about Rita and the entire backstory and tried to get his advice and it is what is is, as..My skin, well, my face is feeling so smooth, like I'm loving my skincare routine, like, touching my face is a joy loll, I wanna see my daylio year wrapped!

    Entry: Didn't get cooked at meeting with Dr Nafea which was great, I feel like my breathe has been terrible lately 😭, idk if it's juet meat chunk things stuck in my teeth but it is quite annoying and makes me always want gum. O should get gum thoo. Would make cutting much easier. I still look weird with a shaved face. Ugh should be going to bed now ..Drama finals went really well tho, we got a perfect score!

    Entry: Studied for networking and might just accept that I'm cooked cause I am looking at stuff we've already done like from chap 3 and at this point I'm over it, sooo whatever happens happens. I'm ready for break, I'm also ready for...drumroll. A CUT, yayy, I, yeah, I think I'm ready for one, originally it was cause I was watching one of natural hypertrophy physique review, then I'm just looking at myself like...yeah, a cut!  So look forward to that till the end of the year. I think I'll go till February, tracking would suck? But I dont need to track? But it'll also hurt me if I dont..Mainly cause a lot of stuff I eat is from my mum's cooking, which I am grateful for, but don't know the caloric intake so I'm kinda at a standstill, but, I can just like, reduce how much I eat in every other meal? Including.her meals, so what am I saying, yeah even if she cooks, I can eat less of it, and split it more throughout the day? We gonna make ittt ..Gonna sleep early today, also, met with drama team, I'm really happy with my group, they're all great. I wanna talk to Ethan about relationships cause I don't want him to feel like I'm not sharing info with him, but also cause I have questions and he's really the one person I trust with relationship advice, gotta corner him at TDR maybe..Also watched mortal Kombat today and.it was pretty good, also shaved?? And I look weird now 😭😭 like my face is so long and my lips blend in 😂

    Entry: Actual big or huge milestone today, drove to campusfor the very first time, with mum and Eyitooni. We went for visit day but left early, then we dropped him off at the hackathon which I didn't go to, got networking studying in, but felt very annoyed but feeling tired so won't go too into details, but def will tomorrow depending on if I locked in. I'm like, my throat feels inflamed? Like, probably burped up some acid that burned it or sth 😭😭😭, that made no sense but it's how it feels and it sucks but God willing it'll be gone tomorrow. Gonna head to bed now tho, feeling tired

    Entry: Generally good day with highs and lows ofc. But generally highs, I'm gonna go change my emotion to Happy. So starting off the day, woke up and got dressed and stuff fairly early, symbolic logic class got let out early woo! We didn't even do any work which was nice, ..Ugh the screen is responding slowly, but whatever. Then moved over to networking, we got dynamic joining done!!!! Somehow, thank God it works, like, I'm actually so glad we were able to get it to work. Oh! My electric  toothbruzh came, don't know if I ever mentioned that, but yeah, but the presentation went great and we got the robot moving and stuff which was also great! Nothing broke, it was fun in general, its also the seed party today and like finals week next week. ..Then seed party was great, I GOT A HOMER SIMPSON FUNKO POPPPP, LIKE, that's amazing, plus like this astronaut dude, candy and a blanket, it was from heyzol, and it was shocking cause like, she was walking towards Ben and I immmmediately noticed his discomfort, but she's a great gift giver, I've only really gotten great gifts which I like lol. ..Then finished image processing and I am really proud of the results and the report, 36 pagesssss, read it and weep Dr paulik 😭. Then my brain shut down a bit, then did some Dr nafea research looking into training vs val vs test and I have some more questions for him UGH, UGH I SHOULDVE RUN THAT OHER MODEL,..Also my mum did laundry for me 🥹🥹, bless her, we are the visit day tomorrow and apparently I'm going to be driving too so we'll see how it goes. I've honestly driven in much more stressful environments so I'm not worried, but there was a BAD accident today and was traffic, but, deep breaths. I'm not worried, so a few people are gonna meet my mum and probably Eyitooni, I think we are going to get split up but idk. ..Gonna do my. Night routine and sleep now, we leave at 8 45 so I dont have too much time to overthink things

    My mood Happyish
    
    Entry: Busy busy busy day, locked in tho, for hours on image processing and I'm getting more and more proud of it but it's still a heck ton, and theres still a ton to do, so I'm locking in entire early tomorrow to finish it and turn it in, even if it isn't perfect, goal is to do that before headed to campus, didn't even work out today and ate like a meal and a half. Anyways tho, boutta calm my brain, got a few more things to do but things shouldn't be too bad, I still gotta study for finals which haven't had the chance to, but networking is going well which is great, everyone came in clutch, so yeah I coulmdt have done anything without them ..Had the meeting with Dr nafea today and I don't think it went well, it honestly went horribly, from my pov at least and,well, I think, that's not as important and I don't want to dwell on it here and have it fester in me so ill talk to sarwar about making more progress, but I understand his POV. Anyways, I had a dream where it was like Valentine's day and everyone was with a loved one or something and I was alone, and wow, I felt lonely, like I can kinda feel it in me now, but this is the second big occurrence of my dreams making me feel something I don't think I've ever felt to that extent in real life, maybe third to be honest, I remmeber the dream of looking out the window, literally in the bathroom ehere I am and everything was green ish and the clouds were pronounced and it was just like, absurd. Anyways tho, bought an electric toothbruzh, but yeah I felt LONELY, like crushing loneliness in that dream like wow, also the second one was the feeling of being trapped in prison, but yeah time to brush my teeth, relax and go to bed, then early to rise and grind tomorrowwo

    Entry: I think my glasses are making me have headaches which sucks, pillows too so I'm gonna try to reduce my glasses wearing and see how my body reacts. Feeling quite overwhelmed also contributes to it I suppose. I'm still glad I have some downtime tho. Didn't workout today, didn't even get the chance, but we got networking working which is great, my elbow still hurts I think, like I get random moments of pain but I think it's my body healing it hopefully 😭..Also downloaded nutrilio and started using is which is pretty nice, makes me more mindful about eating which I think is doing me good, and there's nothing too specific which helps too. Wore my second new jacket and I'm liking fashion, like choosing clothes cause 1 it makes me feel confident, and 2 is that it definitely feeds my ego to get complimented, but I wanna like, dive into that cause I think my egos big enough, like, I'm beating myself up over here for hyping myself up or dwelling on what others say about me and I'm like, I gotta reduce my ego, but I feel like it makes me perform better, but at the same time, it also feels like I'm relying on others. like idk if it's contributing to me finding it harder to just be by myself, like, I can definitely say that I enjoy looking good, And same with the facial routine, even if the results are obvious immediately, like my skin isn't glowing like glass in 2 days of using it, even though it often does feel smoother, and no peeling yet, but it's also like insurance for my future self which I like, I also should get some hair conditioner and keep going with my hair routine wash every Sunday. Coding club meeting this Saturday that I definitely would've forgotten. Trying to keep track of everything I need to do in my head is I think contributing to my stress so I'm using this new tool called craft I think and it's helping already alleviate some of that burden. ..Geez I just cracked my jaw and my ear started ringing lol, but yeah, did literally nothing for Dr nafea so I'm feeling pretty disappointed going into the meeting tomorrow but I just gotta put my best foot forward and puff up my chest, ugh this sucks!! Anyways tho. Also gotta update the evaluation code so it evaluates only on the first ecg of each participant..It's already pretty late so gonna be heading to bed now, co Op class tomorrow blech, winter break, I'm so looking forward to it

    Entry: I'm feeling pretty disappointed in myself from the pov of not asking Dr nafea for help or keeping him up to date and stuff, which sucks ;-;, but yeah at least either I email him tomorrow or lock in. Today was chill, back to school, wanted to work out but my left elbow hurts! Like, sharp pain, that i don't feel any when else, it sucked hardddd but I'm gonna rest it but still train lower ..Our final in drama is to like make a play of SNL thing with our group and I got a group that I'm happy with, so I'm happy. My ears have been burning lately, which I honestly deserve cause I treat my headphones like trash and just put them in my ear 😭, alr it's getting super late, it's already super late, time to go night night, worked on networking today but the day mostly flew by. Anyways, catch you aroun..Sarwar and Ethan were talking about the smartest people in comp sci and idk it feels weird being recognized, and sometimes when I least expect it, cause like now I don't really feel any pressure, but then it's like my brain would switch and id feel like everyones pressure on me and like the pressure to perform and be successful and stuff, which like, sucks, and I wonder how much hormones have to deal with stuff, I should really track my eating. Honestly that's what I'm gonna do, to see how my eating affects my health and habits, not just or really even for calories, like, YEAH. It doesn't have to be super precise cause I'm not doing it for calories even if it'll give me like an estimate, I'm mainly doing it to find patterns so I'm pretty excited but idk if it's one of those late night surges of motivation. Honestly even if it is, I'll work on sticking it out, and I got the perfect app - gonna use the same app the daylio people made . ..Omg i won't have made this choiceif I had stopped journaling like I was going to, but I just decided to keep pushing or I guess writing and it took me down this path of maybe a meaningful long term change 🥹🥹, also apparently Dr pkckell got reported, I learned it from Elizabeth who needed help with technical writing ok ok gonna download the app and sleeps

    Entry: Somehow it's already a new month, time flies I guess, and then it's gonna be January but by then we would've made it to Christmas!!!! I'm kinda glad cause like, now I can even look forward to the first few days of summer, the birds singing, the light, the calm, the atmosphere, it's all really nice and reminiscent, and then I can always look forward to the holiday season, I really like having stuff to hope and look towards, makes life much more enjoyable ..Talked with rita and she's sick but I hope she gets well, snowed a teensy bit today and played bg3 with my younger brother, found a secret route to the under dark in the zhentarim place! Also did some work on image processing and I'm fairly happy with how my algorithms turned out, gotta focus on the paper now, probably should've spent more time over this break on it, but what are you gonna do, not gonna make it 30 pages this time, just gonna focus on what I did and why I did it. Used the retinol cream and I think I'm at the point where I can start using it consistently..Re watched the first episode of Pluto today too, off to bed now tho!, ciao and happy New mongh

Now just listening to some chill music, worked on image processing today but not a ton, also did the python course but also not a ton. I did play a bunch of VR, cards and tankards specifically but ended the day jamming in beat saber which was nice. My stomach hurts now tho, I think it's cause I was jumping all over the place ..Also saw some of my old Instagram posts and YEEEEESh, omg I also realize I haven't thought about giraffe or savvy in months, I think the last time I talked* to giraffe was last year Christmas? I hope he's doing good tho, but dang savvy, I wonder whatever happened to him,but yeah I like looking back cause it makes me feel like I've matured lol, even though I know there are parts of me that haven't ..Oh also statted thinking about the possibility of me going into trying to make AGI a thing? It feels like a goal to shoot for, even though it's quite naive, I like having a goal or at least something I'm working towards like in this course

Pretty chill couple of days tbh, 2 more days and we are back at it. Hoping to make good headway on image processing tomorrow and catch up on networking and watch the filters video too so I know what the heck is happening. We got 2 weeks left y'all

    Entry: Played baldurs gate with my younger brother and technically watched a movie with my dad, had a ton of turkey and also a lot of sweets, and butter, made gravy, brownie and mashed potatoes which honestlyyy turned out pretty good. Didn't do much work today, or work at all, which, I slightly, but also kinda not regret, but I am watching the machine learning course, gonna finish the first section. The machine learning model is also getting better? Maybe perhaps, we'll see. Anyways tho, gonna give more of an update later, my temu update also comes!

    Entry: Got this machine learning course and I'm really excited to get started, like, similar to how I was before when I started with Vue, and it's 43 hours so a good amount! I gotta email Dr nafea too tho, but we'll see, but crap. But tomorrow's thanksgiving!! And I want snowwe, but it is what it is. ..I feel, overcast, and like, ..Apparently there was a shooting overnight and there were a buncha cops but I slept through all of it 😭so yeah fun. But yeah recently feeling quite/more and more overcast , maybe I should start getting ready to feel this more and more once everyone graduates, I notice I feel it much less when around other people, or maybe I'm not just used to be more and more in my head, also working on still reducing my calories but I ain't worked out in a while 🥲, worked out as in lifting weights. Also talked with Rita but not as much as usual, she said I had changed - cause of the pic I sent -, mostly cause of the muscles 😭..Tomorrow's thanksgiving, well, thank God we are closer and closer to Christmas, we almost made it y'all, summer me 🥲🥲, right now I feel like, like it feels like so far away, like out of sight out of mind type thing, and I know if there ever comes a time where it's in sight and in mind, then God will help me and we'll see how it goes but back then SUCKED, and I think God that I can now have a free mind and worry about dumb things like how others see me or my caloric intake. Like even now I feel tempted to start thinking of ways everything could go wrong, but I won't. Anyways, my year wrapped is coming up, gonna be 20 soon, well, in like 9 months, but still! Age 19 is weird, it's such a weird number, anywaysss yeah I'm excited for working on the python and data mining course! There are still things I'm unsettled about and kinda miffed, the model keeps over fitting and it bums me outttt, and I wanna get baldurs gate to play with my younger brother 😭..I'll tell him I'm gonna try to see if I can play online from windows. HOPEFULLY it all works out, but yeah, see you in thanksgiving! I don't think my dad's going to work so it'll be like last time, the oil fryer just like, blew up and splattered oil everywhere but thank God no fire or serious injuries ..Also, got on a call with Ethan for working on networking , didn't resist temptations ho 😭 also I got my license exactly a year ago!!! And received the car title today, well not today,but recently, so one step closer to getting the dang car 🥹..Edit..A bit of after hours journaling, I'm finding it, hard, quite hard to imagine.life after graduation and everyone has left and then imagining my life after I graduate, I keep feeling the sense of loss and sadness which is lessening as I'm writing this but if this.ssmester passed by this quickly, next semester will also easily pass by and we'll be getting ready for graduation, checking if graduation gowns fit and so on, the more I think about it the more panicky ish I get, like, right now it's all lessened, but geez,future me, how's it going, if you're reading this afte graduation, what's up?

    Entry: Was honestly pretty productive today, but also ate very little, at least till dinner. Got some good work in for reimbursement and was even able to get another model running for research which was nice. Also worked on networking too but didn't work out, and didn't work on image processing BUT I got a 100 on the first project which was a hugeee ego boost 😭😭 I thank God tho. ..Crap I really should talk to Dr paulik about my futuro. I'm gonna take a day of break cause I've been getting headaches fairly regularly which sucks, I think I'm holding a lot of tension in my shoulders. Also, slept on the couch?? For some reason tonight, my mum woke me up lol, it's still bizarre. I.Our donut presentation went really well, it was quite funny. Anyways, gonna sleep, trying to avoid arcane spoiler sucks

I drove! And idk why I like, willingly wanna feel stressed or on edge when driving lol. ..I didn't get the chance to play any VR ganes 🥹🥹, or any games cause I decided to lock in on reimbursement, and I did lock in and now I'm tired, but the main UI is almost done which is sweet. Also worked on research and made okay progress I guess, nothing groundbreaking, and di some symbolic logic work. I'm feeling a lot like I felt when I did my driving practice, it's wild that it has already been a year but here we are! Oh watched Simpsons and honestly not a lotta anime, no purging or anything from the retinol so I'm pretty tempted to rapidly up the dose but I'll bide my time..Didn't even get to image processing geesh

    Entry: There's something about Saturday's where the time just flies by and it feels like being productive is impossible, you feel me? Tomorrow im gonna email Dr nafea with some questions, then work in drama, image processing, and try to get another model started. Made good progress on the ECG model today but the validation error sucks for some reason. ..I'll have to check to see if the validation is using the nets state instead of just the net itself cause that might be an issue. ..Also told my parents about Dr nafeas offer and idk why I was so scared, they were like, why not just make money first before jumping into a PhD, but I learned that I could go to any state???? Yeah like, i could've gone to the California thing, just something to keep in the back of my mind. Anyways feeling white tired, oh my retinol cream came! And time to see how it works. Gonna start heading to bed

I wasn't planning on doing the seeds giving and kinda stayed out of it but there was extra food so I showed up and Dr hill was there and I still feel really guilty and I should've been honest from the start which sucks - honest as in letting him know when no progress, but it's whatever ;-;, made good progress with Dr nafea code on the onlyzdd model so that's good! I gotta find a good course on python for Ml..Just looked it up and there are a bunch. Didn't even workout today, I know.i know next semester I'm so back 😭😭, idk why, well, ofc I know why, I want new clothes, but I'm really looking forward to my temu orders arriving, theyre gonna give me new styles to try out! Anyways, yeah gonna head to bed. Oh also Dr olla paid us but only 25 dollars so yeah we gonna collect OUR MONEY..It's somehow Friday, sheersh..Also, basically cried when watching arcane ,it's zo well done, even everything from the animation story to the freaking soundtrack

    Entry: I am tired , had a "debate" with Andre about the networking approach for the keyboard broadcasting stuff and I felt like I was losing my composure but we have a plan for tomorrow and Ethan stood up for me which I really appreciated 🥹🥹..Also, I ate a piece of cold beans and it gave me FLASHBACKS TO WHEN I USED TO EAT COLD BEANS AND RICE AND STUFF, like it felt like a memory locked out of my brain xD, but the reminder was kinda nice. Watching musings of a crouton rn and working on Dr nafea stuff and honestly made some good progress. Next semester I just want a peaceful semester God willing ..But yeah quite tired, Rita didn't respond for the entire day which , yeah, ALSO, I started following people on Instagram?? And it feels like, so weird, like a new world opened up that I had locked out as well, posting statuses and stuff, it's wild! ..Also, I'm just discovering a lot of stuff today, covetousness, I just started like, catching that in myself so much more and it makes me be like, woah did my inside out brain just update and give me a new sin?? Or am I just more conscious cause it's a feeling I don't think I've felt in like, idk it's such a weird feeling. Also I did wake up feeling sick, like, nauseous sick, and Madi is also sick, which is not a good coincidence 😭😭, in a week this will be a nice memory, it's somehow already Friday, somehow, SOMEHOW LIKE HOW, also it's 12pm already AHHH, ALSO ITS FRIDAY SOMEHOW, gonna have to lock in on image processing tomorrow for the first milestone, it is what It is :*)..Also watched some arcane episodes, like 2, which was great!!!! Love the show

    Entry: Today was chill, had a meeting with Dr nafea and he gave me a month to decide, A MOTNHH, so December 20 is my deadline, and like, wow I gotta talk to my parents about it and I want to talk to Dr paulik and Dr mina about it, cause it's a tough decision and he's giving me an opportunity that idk, I don't wanna make the wrong decision so I'm gonna pray more about it ..Decisions decisions. Also my younger brother finally downloaded baldurs gate and is setting up the characters and ingot excited like reminding me of when I first got it she the ton of choices we get...I was starving for a good amount of the day, like really hungry cause no food apart from breakfast, also had a headache which isn't very cash money, but essentially then we were working on networking and sarwar went to get Popeyes and brought some for me and Ethan God bless him 😭😭, it was so nice and it filled me up before the conflict resolution seminar which was amazinggg, Madi and Andy went iver some good stuff which I kinda used when discussing networking changes with Andre and Ben, which is leading me more and more to feeling like yeah I only really enjoy working in smaller groups where I know others have the same drive? Passion? And like competence? It all sounds mean and condescending when I write it down and I don't intend for it to be like that, like I can't make someone care the way I do, and I don't or can't hold it against them, like Dr Carmona said ..Soo, right now after the networking discussion I just realize more and more that for next semester, I want it to be as stress free as possible, including my relationships so that's the relationship or conclusion im drawing. We'll see how it goes!! ..I really have to think and ask my parents about the PhD decisions cause, dang,..ALSO I BOIGHT MY WINTER OUTFITS FROM TEMU, also up late cause I'm talking with Ethan, he's such a joy to talk to..Also, had some strange dreams tonight I wish I wrote down, one was so beautiful, I was like, omg is that what heaven feels like, kinda wanna cry, but like, I looked out the window and the sky was this beautiful blue green and the clouds stood out and my first instinct was to take a picture. It's funny because it was the bathroom window and I feel like it's not the first time I've had a dream with sky's like that

    Entry: Hi, lol this is a late entry but today flew by, I FINISHED BALDURS GATE, and had issues setting up my bootloader and tried to understand how the boot process work, from the firmware uefi or bios, looking for the bootloader which is often stored in the EFI partition, but I was just having issues upon issues, and I'm thinking either I stick with what I have now, where I can boot to both windows or Linux - with some issues, then I can reset my windows and start from scratch and use unity there and all that good stuff, haven't thought through it fully yet tho but that's prolly what I'll do. Next headache in happy terms is that the new image processing peoject is out and I'm like, UghhHhh why don't think just work 😭, I'll go to his office hours and kinda talk to him about it cause it feels like I'm just working in the dark...Just set a reminder, can't keep going like this 😭, also I wanna cut my hair, well not me cutting my hair, but I wanna get a trim and everything, the top of the hair is kinda wonky and doesn't curl as much or as well as the bottom so I'm thinking that if I cut it, then mayhaps it'll be fine, idk idk 😭, maybe I should get a protective hairstyle..Anyways it's already late and i keep waking up later. Gonna finish drama tomorrow - didn't today cause of baldurs gate 😭, gonna start off with it actually, then transition to image processing and gonna finish video 1, as much as it irks me, we are finishing off strong, 2 weeks left 😭, I WANNA DO MY STUFF, AND WORK ON MY PROJECTS UAEGGH, or do I? I feel like I just have the idea or romanticize the idea of me doing my own thing but all the things I'm doing now are much better than anything I'd wanna do. Anyways tho I'm chilling...Once I get annoyed with image processing I believe I'll work on making it easy to test models

    Entry: Today was chill, ended the day watching arcane which was fireeee. It also basically rained the entire day which you know I love. Up pretty late ik ik, also woke up pretty late, like 8 30, but it was a good enough sleep, idk something I kinda wanna comment on is, idk, but sometimes journaling makes me feel things more? Or like unearths them in a way that manifests, sometimes good sometimes bad. Like it was amazing for helping me not short circuit in figuring out my typing and online relationship habits...On the other hand, I mentioned me feeling miffed about sarwar not really (he does, but I see how much work he puts on senior design) - CRAP I HAVE TO TALK TO DR MINA ABOUT SENIOR DESIGN, but yeah Idk why it felt like, uh my screen is typing slowly, essentially I started feeling like he's not pulling his weight which annoyingly is mostly in my head and it makes me less zealy to do the work ;-;. Also I realllly do have to get my diet under control 😭..CRU volleyball game we'll see . Even had popcorn when watching arcane which was different

    Entry: I'm still really happy I was able to clarify how I felt to her and she was able to easily brush it off and we just kept talking, which was great. Originally I thought she was mad at me because I hadnt texted her earlier, which at first made me miffed because it went back to the discussion about me not wanting to feel like I have to be at their beck and call and I like having time to wait before sparking a conversation, and I think when it comes to sky it might be the same thing cause I would be thrust ino conversations when maybe I didn't want to or wasn't comfortable with so I then pished it away, new part of psyche unlocked. We talked and it was chill. Also worked out and briana was there which was also chill , even spoke Spanish for like a lil second in front of Mohammed, random detail but whateverrrrr ..Pretty tired now, but Cru was great, things were chill tbh, except not much orogress on Dr nafea front and sarwar isn't locking in as much as I would like, I have to talk to him about him doing work when I'm not there and taking the initiative himself so he doesn't feel like he should only get work done when I'm there', but whatever..Not Ethan taking random pics on my phone 😭

    Entry: Previous entry was me in the morning but didn't send, now it's me and I haven't made my intentions clear but I will, I think I'm feeling better but still navigating things, she said I spoke like an AI, which, dang, I did and it just hit me that that's also part of the problem, like, I know slash noticed I spoke/speak the same way with alegs, like a different brain profile so that's something new about me. SOMEHOW ITS ALREADY WEDNESDAY..Crap yeah that is wild, anyways, I got linu his gift, it's a cyber punk hand for holding a controller and I think it's sick. Anyways tho, I hope I get a good present 😂, I DIDNT BOMB image processing which is great, like for a 93 ish percent which, THANK GOD...Also, I don't really know how to address me speaking like an AI, I think it's me not being authentic, and like the different persona makes me feel sucky, so like, I'm approaching chatting with them like anyone else, like I was trying to analyze how I felt when texting Ethan or sarwar, or even Josephene, like I didn't really feel anything, no fear or worry, just, yeah they're a part of my life so I chat with them, so that's the same mindset I'm gonna start doing, and another thing I noticed is that I'm scared of them taking up all my time and them, them being rita mainly, like, wanting more of my time than I have to offer them, so I'm scared to leave them on read or not continue a  conversatin.When I'm busy, which is something I'm working to get over, and be able to communicate with them while not feeling like I'm indebted to or forced to, and not feeling like I have to sacrifice work or productivity to talk with them, so it's something I'm gonna be making more clear with myself, I think this has been a nice moment of growth, i think I'm gonna change my mood, but I'm also kinda pressed about something but I dont know if I'm more annoyed at the situation or the person, essentially Ben had added untested code and changed around a bunch of stuff that we hadn't discussed and I don't like it and I want to say something but I decided to hold my tongue till we all come together, then I will rationally and logically ask him to explain his reasoning and do my best to understand him without jumping to conclusions but also ask him questions that will help both of us, but mainly me understand his approach better. LIKE A REASONABLE ADULT PERIODT, yeah I'm feeling jazzed, tomorrow is my chill day so I'm gonna get a headstart on image processing project 2, I also emailed Mike about reserving fitness center for Cru event, yeah, look at me go thank God! We are somehow already halfway through November

    Entry: RITA ETOKUDOH, THATS HER NAME, we were talking and she took a vid of her dorm with her name on the wall. I feel like that's a part of a memory unlocked. And I'm enjoying talking to her, but Im also going to acknowledge that I am not looking for a relationship, and it's something that I am going to clarify cause I need to be clear with my intentions. I'm learning how to navigate the relationship as it is now, and trying to make realizations about myself and why I shy away or feel the way I do when like, I'd be avoiding people in sky or the relationship with alegs compared to like with mantas and pise

    Entry: Okay so, dictioness texted me!! And I feel, okay so here's how it went, I saw that she had followed me and I hesitated but I followed her back, then she sent me a message, like, I won't have known if I didn't check my Dms but I responded and SHE RESPONDED LIKE IMMEDIATELY, like, she said how she could've been mad at me and how she loved me but I ghosted her, and I'm like, I feel stupid, and idk , like, I can't really wrap my head around someone saying they loved me and I also feel really really bad about how I just ghosted her because I got scared, like I got that feeling, something similar to what I'm getting with alegs that i do..Nt respond even if I'm very capable to because I'm scared of being swept up in a conversation with them and it's something I'm working on fixing, and being clear like, I'm busy now but I'll read it once I'm free, and not just ghost them, but she had said that she didn't forgive me and I told her that I understood, but I eventually tried to explain my point of view, not as a way of giving her an excuse but for giving her the explanation she deserves because this has also been weighing on my mind for a good while now, and she said that she understood, just partly tho but I'm really happy I just didn't end the conversation when she said she didn't forgive me, because There was a point where .It felt like there was nothing really to say, but thank God that wasn't the case. But now we are talking again and I hope to be better this time. I can't say that I'm going to pursue anything, I don't think I will, but I still want to be good friends with her and be able to talk to her like I used to. And then I even had a mseting with Andy where we talked about dating and I really wanted to bring it up and I think he could kinda tell but I both parts felt bad about how I handled the situation and was so scared of him changing how he saw me because of my actions. ..I was not expecting all this to happen but I'm really really glad I could rekindle the relationship ..But I still can't wrap my head around it, like I thought that after the time had passed she'd have outgrown me and realized that the emotion wasn't love or something, maybe I'm just too stupid, but I really, ARGH, I'm really really happy to be honest , and I'm also happy that this is what's on my mind, because there are things about my future that I haven't processed and possibilities I don't want to consider, but I really should put my trust in God and try my best to follow him..Maybe I should add a new emotion or feeling because wow, it's like, I didn't know how I should feel, I felt like I should smile because it all felt so distant but like, I also knew I should be sad and I think my brain was trying to cope thinking I'm just thinking about being sad but it did weigh on me, and I'm still happy that everything is turning out as it is thank God..Also I'm getting fat, gotta.slim down

Im listening to the lofi version of geysers and gullies. ..After the election, you def know what has been on my mind, and I honestly can't say I'm worried, but I feel like I should be, and somehow the weekend is always over. Idk, I can't say I'm worried but I can say my perspective on things have shifted quite a bit since, like just, seeing everything around me, feeling, transient, like, just in general even, I could quite literally die tomorrow, or tonight. Both things are unlikely but freaking possible. ..I'm not necessarily stressed about either too, it's just on my mind, and I dont know but I think I've accepted the way things are, or maybe I've not, I really don't know at this point, my mental state has been kinda shaky lately, not unstable, not depressed, just like, prone to shifts, but idk if it has been really any different? Maybe I'm just getting better at numbing myself or being more dramatic! Like, I still feel excited about things and wanna do things, but at the same time I'm holding things with a looser grasp, why get too attached to anything if it might all be gone

I have a barely functioning algorithm but it works for now 🥹🥹.I do have some thoughts on how to improve it but we'll see if I get the time to do it tomorrow. Ugh 9am class. ..Anyways, pretty chill day even played asgards wrath, loving the bow weapons. What else what else WENT DRIVING AND IT WENT SO SMOOTH. It was to everyday foods which feels much easier than going to Aldi. There were barely any comments and it was just chill in general, thank God, driving is starting to feel more and more natural woo, the practice is doing me good, can't wait to actually be fully time driving. I gotta stop making thinking about graduation a pasttime..We have essentially like a month and a week till finals. JEEEEEEEEE CRAP CRAP UGH gotta lock in for Dr nafea. Gonna go to bed now, and try not to overthink things, cua

    Entry: Fairly productive day tbh, played asgards wrath for like 2 hours, and made good progress on image processing and started writing the paper, sweet! And also doing the sprint 4, I think the storm is close to being over so I'm quite happy about that...Also my toner came, and apparently my mum knows about it and she gave me some cotton pads WHICH I DDINT KNOW WE HAD WOO. Hmm, also my brother thought it was gonna be me doing laundry 😭, he wnded up doing it but mum took over like halfway through. I watched so much brain rot content loll, and like, Im probably most definitely replacing Lilly Singh with Alana lintao which sounds so weird but like, they're quite motivating! And like chill so I really like just working and having weird motivational quotes in my EAR THAT SOUNDS SO WEIRD LOL. ..Coding club might be starting again next week..Don't have much more to say tho, yuhh..Had a fake waking up dream where I got my image processing midterm grade, terrible joke dream spirits😭

    Entry: Feeling slightly miffed. Spending a lot of time on image processing project without a lot of progress which hecking sucks. It's late and I just decided to wash my hair to take my mind off it, it's quite , ugh ..Had a meeting with Dr nafea that went well tho, and feeling much better than I was yday thank God. Classes were fairly chill, ive been watching this fishing anime which is a pretty fun watch, nothing too deep. ..Im enjoying my skin care era , but wow I haven't felt miffed like this especially about something coding related in a while, and I keep FLIPPING COMPARING MYSELF, my brain can be quite annoying :*) anyways gonna head to bed now, ciao..Actually before I leave , I'm finding myself more and more picturing graduation and I can feel myself like tearing up, like, reminds me of the feeling.of the first Simpsons episode of this season where everything is closing up. Like, I feel like a lot would change, craaaaaaapppp. Nows not the time to be thinking about it, I should take more pictures

    Entry: Took the image processing midterm today, we'll see how it goes 😬😬, I felt very strange, idk I often feel strange in the class. I feel like I'm constantly competing and losing against Evan which ik is stupid and is def not the case for him and he doesn't see it that way. Annoyingly the brain doesn't what the brain thinks it wants but I'm not letting it get away that easy so I know it's just a passing and inconsequential thing so I'm not placing too much emphasis on it, but taking the exam and having the feeling around me was just plain annoying..Anywaysss, IT WAS HALLOWEEN AND I FORGOT. Madi came as sadness from inside out which was hilarious, I'm bummed I didn't do anything since I just missed a cool opportunity but it is what it is ;-;, anyways, exfoliating my skin makes it feel so nice..Okay I'mma stop beating around the bush, IT FEELS LIKE EVERYONE AROUND ME IS TRYING TO GET, OR IS ALREADY IN A RELATIONSHIP AND IM THE ODD ONE OUT. which I'm is just because of the people I'm surrounded and if I only surrounded myself with single people, then I most likely won't feel like this, especially because it's not an issue I thought I'd have for a while, but apparently Ben was pursuing things with Heyzol and orieakose is looking at someone now, Andre with Josephene and Ethan with Abbie, Lukas, I mean he has known her for a while, and just like, ARGH I feel like I'm getting relationship FOMO but I also can't distinguish between whether I'm ready for an actual relationship or again whether it's FOMO ..To be honest, I think it's mostly FOMO, and I'm not like, craving an emotional relationship with someone , even though it would be nice, but like whenever they're talking about it I feel about of place and like I'm falling behind , or like I'm not doing enough to secure my future. And I know for sure that's not their intentions and they're gonna discuss what they're gonna discuss, it just makes me feel like I'm lagging behind which I'm not a fan of, but I also have to come to terms with being comfortable being single, at least for now. Like, maybe my master's year I'll start looking to pursue someone, but idk, it's a new dynamic and a new feeling, like I'm getting, not pre stressed, but like pre overwhelmed of being in the state where I'm now looking at female interactions like potential relationships and like, I don't wanna be in a spot like that and I'm already struggling to do that and struggling to connect with some because of my dumb head ..Now I'm overthinking not having said hi to Angela at the fitness center and planning how to bring it up in my next conversation with her eugh. I don't want that for me now, lifes already too complicated, ..Almost forgot to do my elevate for yesterday technically yeesh,.anyways yeah, I really have to accept that people around me are going to be growing relationally and getting into relationships and stuff and Im either waiting for God's time or gonna dawdle around, but essentially now is not the time for me to be thinking about relationships really ..Today was a productive day but I started feeling quite overwhelmed with the Dr nafeas stuff combined with image processing, gotta chill for a second cause I'm thinking I'm moving closer to my limits but idk, I still have s good amount of free time and haven't needed to sacrifice sleep so have I really been as busy as I'm always touting. I can't really compare myself with anyone else to know what busy means so I still guess I can't know

    Entry: Had a great spiritual conversation with sarwars. Didn't start off the day great with you know what, and I've had a runny nose for the entire day but I really enjoyed our conversation and even though we were supposed to be doing work, I found it much more productive to talk to him about it. .aND I ALMOST FORGOT but I also talked to Ben! And it was also very enlightening and like, I truly have to say that, and idk if it's just me being dramatic but me almost losing my voice feels like it was meant to happen as I found myself just listening and forcing myself to listen and putting myself in that place and it helped me empathize better and we got to a good conclusion on honestly many topics and I'm glad I was able to let out how I feltand see his point of view..Then I went with Andre and Ethan for an architecture event which was great fun too, and then chatted with orieakose, had to leave Bible study before it started 😭 but I really like interacting with the Cru community...Anyways, crap I gotta email about volleyball event, I haven't seen Johnathan in a while, also going through Romans with Titus and the others and kinda looking forward to it, gonna read a chapter tonight and like probably send a message in there, also gotta talk to Alfred, but before all that, we lock in for image processing. Study the images in the textbook and the transformation, and work more on the project to start fine tuning the algorithms. Also gonna turn in study of drama midterm tonight woo...HOly CRAP MATT LAUER ALSO TEXTED ME AND iT just gave me like flashbacks to the summer and my original plan was to scurry and ghost but I thank God I responded to him, gave him an update on how things are going and it was a quick nice chat, like, Thank God for that 🥹🥹

Skin feeling nicer but no really visual change, OF COURSE like duh. Anyways gonna head to bed now, listened to some chill music today and it was chill..

Got my Paula's exfoliant, which I used and felt really nice and made my face quite soft. I don't like the combed out hair so gonna get my curly hair back 😭😭..One year from my first driving lesson which is weird to think about. Don't have a ton to say honestly, so see you tomorrow

Worked on image processing homework and study of drama as well, which was honestly like, fine, didn't finish drama and didn't work on any research over this weekend :*) , ugh gotta lock in, gonna do the data stuff either in class tomorrow or right before meeting ..Apart from that, pretty chill day, made pizza..Also combed out my curls :*), but I miss them so I'm gonna bring them back

And double points, we won second place in the image prompting thing. ..Thennnnn, we did the ICPC and all glory be to God I won first place and got a 50 dollar Amazon gift card, so that's a 75 plus 50 plus whatever we get for winning, then my younger brother got the airpods finally and gave them to me 🥹🥹

    Entry: Gonna write here before I get too tired. I had a bunch of great dreams tonight and I think they all had Ethan in them lol. One of them I was looking at the stars like I was in orb movement of the earth and I still remember that view and omg it makes me want to actually learn how to lucid dream so bad. Maybe I'll start back on it again ..Anyways, the morning was amazing, cold, rainy, still pretty cold but the morning was chef's kissss, didn't want to get up for nada. But did, went to class and that all was pretty basic, networking lab was okay, we were setting up sth new and thank God everything just worked for me, it was great! Then went to the hackathon and Karn was there, in this case I'm keeping all my comments to myself because ik the part of me that is trying to come out - the one that automatically characterizes and boxes people into one like, box xD and it felt like my default sense was not to like him? But then I'm no better than you know who and UGHH the more I think about it the more it just feels hard to let go cause I know I have to do it and nothing feels right unless I do..And I know I need to but frick it's tough out there 😭😭 apart from that tho, the hackathon commenced! And guess whatt, I did not win the Kahoot, so close but I GOT SECOND PLACE AND IM HAPPY. Like, really happy, we thank God :D.im gonna do the breathe project with Josephene and jade and we'll see how that goes!!! It's bound to be interesting. Anyways, already kinda dozing off so gonna head to bed now, ciao

This them late night ramblings, but also coding is like, like the easy kind of coding, it's pretty nice to just shut off my brain and let things move. It's like good therapy and relaxing juice for the mind, like it's running on low power xD...Anyways I had my coop presentation today and I think it went pretty well, I'm happy with how things turned out tbh

    Entry: Feeling highly productive tbh! My younger brother got accepted into UDM which is not because I was productive but whatever xD. After class I went to the student accounting office to check on my tuition remission, well first was sending emails, then got sent around, sent another email, AND THANK GOD they just applied my 3000, like thank flipping God. I wasn't stressing and just kinda trusted him that things were moving in the background and they were 🥹..I'm also really happy because Dr mina said shes gonna pay me 1200 for the reimbursement work over the summer which is amazing :D, and I'm really really happy about,Dr Hill already filled out the tuition remission form tho since I asked him to, he did it 10 days ago and it's wild that it was 10 days ago I talked to him?? It was for 1800 so I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow! And try to see how the process works is the remission is higher than the balance and if I can go into negative balance. ..I'm also gonna ask the students office but thank God like, part of my wanted to do the whole being scared and shutting down thing but I just kept moving and emailing and meeting and I'm just so happy I can register. My next semester is also looking HELLA. Nice, like chefs kiss. Also locked in and made pfogress on converting to H5 file for Mimic, like periodt pooh

    Entry: Somehow it's already halfway through the week. Today was honestly a blur, like I did some image processing studying earlier to brush up on Kay transforms, how Fjk is moving from j to k which is equal to how to transform a point from coordinate point k to j. Anyways, moving from that, went to Cru and we got a good number of people, Anita was there too and the food was great. Then senior design and networking which we didn't have lecture and he just went over our grades and how we did...Andre kept thinking we were filtering what we were thinking but for me that wasn't the case and I'm tired of trying to deal with that, there's a good amount of stuff I'm tired of dealing with, but that's for another day. Anyways, we got the coop presentation tomorrow, yay ;-;,..But I played some beat saber cause I couldn't work out, then worked on reimbursement and watched videos about Nigeria which got me feeling conflicted. I also had my advising meeting and talked to Dr mina who is somehow always in meeting with Karen but I'm fine with that 😭😭..I've also been doing so much better with brushing my teeth and I'm now in a good place with my hair care, soo im thinking of moving on to skin care. I've been noticing my skin has been feeling much worse lately, and I'd like to change thatttg, I have so much stuff on my Amazon wishlist dang

    Entry: Lazy day :*), I started today feeling very overwhelmed with like image processing and drama and everything, like it felt like the emotion came from nowhere, but last night was truly something ,like hearing the footsteps in the apartment was terrifying!!!..Anyways, yeah I read the textbook for some pages for image processing and scheduled office hours with dr paulik cause i gotta make sure I'm understanding everything, so we are gonna meet with him tomorrow at 5 30. So sfter that I worked a bit on sprint 1 document and then I just bummed out for the rest of the day. I'm planning on doing drama monologue tomorrow, and reading ahead for networking tomorrow as well, cause gotta use this chill time to the most advantage. Kya also messaged me! And I messaged back but the Convo is kinda dry 😭, I'm gonna try to respark it, tomorrow fho, and Titus also texted and we messaged a bit about like, the important and ways to approach worship, and why I shouldn't overly focus on apologetics, and should focus on knowing God which he is very right about..I'm also finding that the negative emotions I was feeling towards Ben and Andre last semester and I guess this semester too are kinda lingering after the Convo with Ethan but they're at least under control.Anyways, gonna go to bed now, ciao

Like I reached a point where I didn't know if it was all in my head just cause of how many voices ricocheting off each other Angrilg sounded

    Entry: Worship night was honestly great and I'm feeling lighter, I also kinda really wanna speak with some people, oh I had one of the best cathartic conversations Ive had in so long and I'll tell you all about it later hehe, listening to the way podcast now..Edit .Okay now I am home, so after the networking lab, which we got to redo the exam which was great! I got a 94 on the exam originally which was amazinggggg, and at first I didn't want to try to fix my code but thank God I did, so I addressed some small things and tried to answer the last question and almost gave up but the answer dawned on me at the last moment - I think/am praying that was the case, and if it was I'm.happy! But anyways, yeah I'm glad he made it so that we could retake the exam, and people like Ethan could redo the exam. ..So we went to get dinner together and we talked a lot about last semester and I talked to him.about I feel about wanting Madi to pour into Sydney, and then also about Ben and Andre and their work ethic and last semester and kinda dumped my brain into him, and I find that we share a LOT of the same opinions, but even after I don't feel particularly, accomplished? Like how I feel after worship night, lol, like, I dont feel like anything like got resolved, and I don't wanna force myself to think that something did get resolved. It was just a nice rant session that felt good temporarily

I'll also do networking stuff tomorrow, no Dr mina class tomorrow woo! Feels like everyone's worried ..We also chalked today! And omg I really wanna ask Madi to talk more with Sydney cause I think there are some things she needs to work on, which I know is very hypocritical of me to say or even type but i find that those behaviors could be destructive and don't want her to get too caught up in it. ..Ugh my brains drifting, I'm feeling the sweet embrace of sleep, take me away ;-;

    Entry: Pretty chill but also kinda busy day, didn't even get to finish my full workout but the highlight was talking to Anna, like I was posting up flyers and she walked by and then we started talking, I started posting up flyers like, maybe at 3 actually , but actually maybe at 2, cause then we started talking, yeah since drama was at 4, and we talked for about 2 plus hours, of like, the world and culture and food and covid and I was honestly so engaged and it didn't feel awkward like how I feel when talking with other women, like I often feel like I'm talking down to them? But she's so learned that I don't feel like that and I really like that, the conversation went super fluidly and it was all natural, like we literally sat on the stairs and talked there for about an hour and I didn't get bored or was worried about the next conversation ..That's what I want a significant other to be like 🥹🥹, that'd be so cool. Speaking of SOs, ETHAN AND ABBIE ARE NOW DATING, he handpicked flowers and everything, i feel happy for him, and them honestly, they deserve it. I totally don't feel left out LOL, but I truly am happy...Anyways, we chalking tomorrow! And Brianna is gonna be there as well and idk why I got scared 😂😭, Idk idk I'm just being weird. Anyways, yeah, I walked a bunch trying to hang out flyers, gonna pray then head to bed..Also talked to Andy bout Ben

    Entry: Also very temptation heavy day but we pushed through. But, I should really stop looking or searching for temptation, cause, yeah, I'm being a dumb head and making it harder on myself. Today wasn't super productive and in fact, I didn't do much but that's fine. No networking lab exam scores, so that's fun. It's also raining, kinda, which is nice..Also drove to Aldi today, for the first time, which went pretty well tbh but it was also a pretty basic path. Gonna read the Bible before I go to bed, job is going through a heck ton, like, specifically chapter 6 ish where he's like, I could try to clean myself up and forget everything but I know what comes after this and if I've angered God so much, then I'm already doomed and know I will end up in the pit of hell, which must suck HARD.And side note, my heart goes out to all the people experiencing the war and stuff, And even people in much worse scenarios than I am now, like lately I find myself worrying more about stuff like whether I'd have to go back to Nigeria to start again, and whether I'm even Nigerian enough and the situation I would find myself in and its this ebb and unebbing of Logic and Just seeing how many people are going through much worse things makes me reevaluate ..And realize that I am still in a very fortunate position thank God, and I pray that everything is able to work out for good, but I also know that his will may and probably will be different from my will, so may his will be done

Was semi productive today but I'm honestly just happy I was able to stay away from temptation, we've made it to a week boys!!..Thank God. I'm still reading Job but didn't watch many Christian content today, did and turned in networking and image processing homework. I don't really have much to say, it's raining

    Entry: I was gonna put bad but I don't feel bad, I felt angry and unfairly treated. My brother had his homecoming tiday and we were going to pick him up so I drove and it was just one thing after another and some things I take responsibility for and other things no, but I just got angry in a perhapsssss not very Christian like manner ;-;..Ugh I'm like, looking up dental implant costs and I don't wanna think about it eugh. But, ugh there is a few things I wanna talk about ..Me not knowing what I want and really how to make decisions ..Me realizing there's more wrong with me than just sexual sin ..Me being, idk if its a me or human thing but emotions being wildly, like, wild ..For the first thing, Ethan was talking in class about Abbie and it was okay and all, but I started thinking to myself whether I should be making an effort to put myself out there or something, but then I didn't know whether I was actually ready for a relationship and I started asking myself how I would know when I was ready and I couldn't answer the question. I eventually settled on, whenever God wants me to have one, he would put someone in my life, but they feels like a cop out answer lol. So yeah I statted just like going down the rabbit hole of now knowing who I am and like whether I want to do a PhD, stuff like that. I'm just like, at this point blindly selecting choices and hoping for the best really. Idk ..Then my second point, I'm realizing just how much work I still have left, like, in terms of jealousy or envy, in terms of just saying thank you after my brother picks and drops me, in terms of not judging and holding random weird grudges, so yeah I find that, it's a battle, and I'm working on addressing ine part of the Battle and i can't neglect the other part. ..Okay I'm getting tired but last point, when I was angry, my mind drifted to the tooth thing and it all seemed so small ahd pointless and like, I'm wondering, WHY IS THE BRAIN LINE THIS. Something that made me quite worried just brushed aside like that etc, and then there's the thought of imagine that I had testicular cancer when my balls were hurting, and putting teeth into comparison, like, everything seems so much more trivial, like even now just thinking about it, it's literally teeth. I think it even made me thankful and praise God for having just the tooth thing xD, I'd choose tooth thing any day so like, there's so much good going on and being worried about a tooth is still kinda weird but it is what it is ..Wowee I'm already dozing off. It's my laundry day tomorrow, fun, but I don't mind it

Also, noticed a black spot on one of my teeth earlier today and kinda got into worrying about whether it was tooth decay buttt I'm leaving my anxieties on Him and right now I'm focusing on what I CAN do which is to start twice a day 😭😭

I didn't overly dwell on it and will continue to place my faith in God. ..Was even a productive day as we got sarwars computer running with the model so now we can train at double speed. Tomorrow I'll get the data that's based on the timing and I look forward to it hopefully also having good run time..I even got meal swipes!! These things are kinda unrelated but honestly theyre making me feel like I had a really productive day and I'm here for it. No image processing but I locked in on the homework and on Dr nafeas homework and even studied for the lab exam tomorrow.

    Entry: Today was, good, but I'm happy. Like it's cold, got to class fairly on time, didn't meet with Mike or Dr nafea but had lunch with Sammy and Sydney, i found out she liked Greg!!! Or Tyler hehe, which was pretty surprising cause she doesn't show it at all. I really really want Madi to pour into her. Ugh I'm gonna ask Madi tomorrow, I'm sure I'll see her, Madi has also been looking pretty tired so I'll ask her if she's doing well, she has only been bringing candy to Wednesday Cru which is honestly not a big deal but I think it might mean that sth else is going on but I also acknowledge that I could very much be reading too deeply into things..Anyways I had a good workout, finally got money to buy meal swipes, and I'm gonna ask 1, Dr mina about any updates with Legalmeasure payment, but not only that, also on the VR project. I'm also gonna check in with Dr nafea since I haven't gotten paid and I really want to get paid before November😭😭, we got a month left tho so I'll ask him next week, and if he gets back to me the following week, or maybe I can talk with Dr Hill or something so I can at least register ..Anyways tho, yeh I gotta have faith that things are moving cause I really don't know what's going on behind the scenes, I'll ask Dr mina, and then Dr Nafea on Monday, so timeline is Monday..Gonna lock in on homework tomorrow, also contacted Sal and made the Crumittee for event planning today

    Entry: I forgot how much I loved just existing in the cold, like I was moving around doing my day stuff and even cooked lentils and didn't realize how much I missed the smell and taste! Like surprisingly a lot!! But like, yeah I forgot how much I loved the code. ..I spent about an hour early today reading James and doing some studying, listening to Caleb Gordon now and it's slowly growing on me. Also had a quick conversation with Titus and Sammy, and gonna start introducing crumittees tomorrow. Studied networking a lot today which was honestly great, and watched asobi asobase which is hilarious as usual,..Something that stood out when reading James was the fact that God doesn't tempt us, and he is not tempted to do evil, and our evil and sinful nature causes us to have lustful and sinful desires which breed sin which breeds death. Ik I'm supposed to be reading Job but James has so much knowledge!

    My mood Motivated
    
    Entry: Listening to Caleb Gordon rn on the recommendation of Cole and he has some bangers, it's rap music which I'm not accustomed to but the lyrics make up for it ..Ive been watching a YouTube channel called the way and I'm really enjoying it cause it feels like a Bible study where they talk about and read verses. I'm still quite not quite sure what it looks like for me to have a personal relationship with God but feelings can be deceptive and I can rely on the word of God. Which I need to apply to the doubts I sometimes feel, idk if I talked or technically wrote about this before or whether it's all in my head.. but I don't have any issues praying to God and like marvelling at his work through the beautiful things he has given us like Paul said, but whenever I am in a big crowd that is worshipping him like during worship at FG, it's like, I start to question myself and whether this is all true and whether I'm just in some big organized cult, and I feel like I know that's not the case but I then feel like that's what I'd feel like if that was the case, like I feel like me shoving those doubts aside like by saying that it's just the devil trying to weaken my faith or that I'm just scared of what my new.Life would look like makes me feel like I'm falling right into the trap? Like I'm shutting down the logical part of my brain, but I also feel that I believe in God and Jesus and honestly that feels much stronger and I feel much more connected to him than any feelings of doubt, like maybe I'm just sick but as I've been doing this I've been feeling his presence more, and idk like right now I defaulted to looking at materialistic areas of my life where I can see him in me, like specific ones but quickly.realized that that's not what this is all about so that thought didn't last long, but yeah I have these feelings that I feel are trying to not only deceive but confuse me and before I forget, I was going to mention like..If I feel this way, it doesn't matter because at the end of the day it'll only do me good even if it all turned out to be fake but that's STUPID, like, I'm not trying to be lukewarm and if an all creating all loving being exists and there's a heaven with him and I know and can feel him and have a relationship with him, then why would I treat him like my backup. Ugh I was gonna do some more bible reading but now I'm getting sleepy. I'm going to go into James because the way podcast is going into it and I'm really enjoying it and feel like it is speaking to me. ..I'm also looking to organize a UDM cru event for volleyball on the suggestion of Gregory and Trevor which I'm really happy they're talking outside CRU and i really really would love to see the community grow, even though I am a bit, nervous? Maybe more than a bit, more like overwhelmed x nervous but through christ I can do all things ..

    Entry: The school visits were great! Like much better than I thought, Myriam erol and grace were great company, but that's not what I'm here about. I'm challenging myself to only watch Christian related videos for the entire week, and some about learning too 😭, but mainly.christian videos, and not just watch but listen cause I'm finding myself always attaching.things spoken about to other people and really, the moment of lying down with a voice on the verge of being lost and just having to listen made me realize how much more of a different skill it is and how much I need to control my urges to always hop in in my head

    Entry: I've got a lotta thinking and praying to do. Got back from fall getaway today after some charged conversations and went to golden corral which was crowded but I liked the mac and cheese. ..During campus times, we answered the how deep will you go question cards for a level 1 and 2 and we got sidetracked into the conversation of friendships and kinda the work that they take and the struggle between managing good relations and it's something I very much related to, and talked to Titus on the way home about, and we kinda started talking more and I shared with him that I've been journaling for as long as I have and I was telling him how I'm coming to the realization that I can only work through my issues through journaling so much, it has helped me in many ways but there are more and better ways for me to dig deep into myself, as I was lying on the bed in the room listening to Emma nissen and Ruth etting, I was reakizijg more and more that theres a .Ton idk about myself and I can't even explain or describe my personal relationshio with God and what it looks like, and my definite first step is to get a consistent bible reading practice going. ..I'm looking forward to the CRU community growing and I'd love to see the GroupMe flourish but that's me getting side tracked, I also confided in him about my struggles with envy and jealousy and it felt like he also related to that, and he offered that I can always text him and it sounds like God is calling me to start taking this all seriously, like I was realizing during the last quiet times by the lake that I have a master servant relationship with God but not a father son relationship, like, i don't feel like I know him like a father but as Titus also said, feelings can be deceptive and all I can really do is take solace in his words, which honestly is something I really needed to hear. Maybe God was talking to me a lot more than I realized. I felt the continuous push to talk to Sal and Sydney one to one and I am still bummed I never did! And I'm bummed I went to the dance party instead of talking with Bri..Making that decision brought me to the verge of losing my voice and I went back inside to rest it and she was gone, and I somehow fell asleep and when I woke up, Cole and Ethan were having a conversation and it was the strangest experience I think, like a first for me, there was this mentally stimulating conversation and all I wanted to do was be like hmmhmm, yeah, this reminds me of..., I'm like..., but that would all have strajned my voice so I was just forced to listen, and listen, and make no other indication apart for sometimes laughing. Thank God my voice is much better now, and I felt like in that moment, I was being punished but also taught something very important and now I have to reconsider silence essentially...I had also read lamentations which was a roller coaster of emotions, and Sammy in the car was talking about how this woman got gunned down for her faith and I just felt so down and sad but the verse in lamentations 3 about there still being hope just kinda lifted me up in a way I wasn't expecting, especially since I most likely. wouldn't have touched it if titus hadn't recommended it ..And one thing I want to discuss with Andy is like, when in big crowds like worship and stuff , it feels like my doubt flares up much more, like, in Bible study I hardly ever feel like God doesn't exist and, like we are being tricked and being fools or something, but when in a large congregation, I don't know but I can start to feel like that and it makes me feel even more unprepared about taking a big step or any step at all. I dont know how my life will change as a result of the decision, like, will I become, idek,  I gotta go to bed but I'll pray and ruminate over it

    Entry: I had a great time, we played uno and Greg won which was fire, I paddle boated with Josephene, so I was on a large body of water for the very first time in my life! Played volleyball but not in the tournament, went to the dance party too, and I'm like 99 percent sure I'm going to lose my voice which is weird to think about, but ooh yeah fall break, it'll be hard to do the presentation thingy with a cracky voice tho so we'll see how that goes ..I'm still like, well I'm gonna continue with what I was saying before, Sammy Titus and I shared about going through sexual immorality sins, you know, and its kinda weird to think about just how many people go through that..Looks like oriekaose is coming, can hear him down the hallway l

I value ..My struggles ..My goals ..Personal relationship with God.Understanding how to forgive and truly love others..I'm gonna go read the Bible cause I think it'd open up more than this

The CRU group got much bigger which is amazing, and I even led the first group meetings and I am honestly really happy about how it went and how the general direction of CRU Is going. I spent a lot of time with new people and it was nice...The bonfire was nice and we talked a ton with a bunch people essentially, connected/chatted with Dre, Cole, Bro, Johnathan, Greg, even Titus on the ride over, and Sydney, etc

Just us home tonight which is cool but I spent the time working on dumb study of drama, counting the days till I get my 18 credits 😭..As of now a few things are falling behind for me, most of them extra curricular, but still, it sucks, and that's part of what's driving my irritability. I'm gonna message Chris tomorrow  telling her I can only do Monday ..Not much to say, prolly will have a lot more to say tomorrow :*)

Worked a good amount on the reimbursement project and Ethan's getting much better and is putting in the work which is great, didjt go to Anita which sucks but IM GONNA DO IT TOMOTROW, I'm super happy about not having to be on campus too early. ..I'm not happy about volunteering for Both days for the dang high school visits over FALL BREAK which is 8 to 3PM LIKE BRUH WHAT, DANG IT PAST ME, WHY DID OU GAVE TO SAY BOTH DAYS LIKE A DUMB HEAD. ..Anyways, Ugh, but yeah, dang I was gonna say sth else, oh yeah, Dr mina said I'm supposed to have gotten paid and the 6500 dollars is somewhere, and I didn't know it was that much which is wild! Which combined with 1500 from Dr Hill and 3000 from Dr nafea, that's about 40 dollars an hour for my summer work which I'm happy with!..Cru was nice and we had to split up but even then at first I didn't want to split up but I really enjoyed splitting up and having better smaller conversations

    Entry: Okay locked in for a while to do some networking studying. Now gonna go to bed early, cardio tired me out. Anyways tho, like, I feel like my body is reacting both good and bad to the milk? Like I'm getting more acne and it started around the general time when I started dreaming more, apart from the occasional tea, but I also started sweating a lot when working out without washing my face so that's also possibly a cause. Should've used the fsykio tracker that I installed ..I feel like my dental healh is trash tho, even gonna brush my teeth rn and buy a new brush

    Entry: Honestly feeling pretty good, had a good chat with Dr paulik after randomly stopping by his office so I think I'll make it a ritual of stopping by after my cardio, I even lifted weights AND did cardio. Weights took longer cause I did them with sarwar but I'm not too bothered, def gonna read over networking tonight, and order a calculator, and start packing for fall getaway! ..Cardio has been nice tbh, like closing.my eyes and just letting myself vent or think about different stuff while learning Italian,and I love seeing the numbers compile on Strava. Future me you better be happy I'm making this a habit 😤😤..Even working very well with Ethan and we are churning out tasks at a fast rate. I really really enjoyed talking with Dr paulik cause I even got to rant about ROS!!! And the transition process. And also, talking with Dr nafea, he said and offered again to do a masters with him..And that I should think more about it, which now I definitely am/will, except then that also involves potentially moving to Missouri which honestly I'm gonna ask my mum about, most likely. Anyways, headed home, not really hungry thank God, I brought crackers and like, the chocy juice but I gotta find a better less sodiumed replacement, and it's also reducing my calories by maybe too much for my liking, especially when combining cardio and lifting and I don't wanna start to lose muscles so either I ramp up eating and find a way to consistently TDR or I reduce volume ..Also I got extra credit for my set design in drama class!!

    Entry: Error 400 (Bad Request)!!1400.That’s an error.The server cannot process the request because it is malformed. It should not be retried.That’s all we know. iod in my parents relationship where my dad would prefer to go to temis shop cause there was much less nagging there, and I remember being the one to always get his password and look through his messages especially when my mum had travelled...I didn't understand why he got angry till much later 😭😭. Anyways, I'm going back to Nigeria ahhh, I remember academic games and going to shake shack but having Ms fisher order for me 😭, she was so nice too, I remember Ms Yates bringing the empanadas and I said they were sweet, which was a terrible word to use, but like, she was so nice!! I remember the trip they wanted to do to Spain, but of course I couldn't go 🥺, but wouldn't that have been amazing. I remember being friends with Kya and Sherita, I REMEMBER ROBOTICS and that one hump to the highway,.and.how loud we got, I remember Mr Alexander being or doing essentially the bare minimum, but I also remember Mr Dixon just doing.his own thing, apparently he had been arrested before?!..I prolly.mentiomed that somewhere here before but anyways, I remember the choir music room where I'd stay when others were singing and I'd try to learn by assigning numbers to the keys, I never really.lesrmed how to sight read 😭 but I think I got good in that time frame and bless Ms Blumenthal , I really really hope she's doing well. Idk if I had mentioned but I believe she had contacted me a while back, don't remember tho ....Also random side note, my insides hurt and I think it's cause I did stress them as I was biking with all the moving and squishing but hopefully they all heal soon. I also poired some water on my computer today, fun, and had a meeting with Nebula to help get firebase working which it did, so thank Goddd.  I remember having to confront Ms Ross after we reported her to the professor, and I remember David going off on her some time.before the pandemic, I think that's when things started getting hard for him, and I remember him even getting angry at ms Johnson or sth like that in an online call. I remember, not very fondly but still remember, the kslt calls, and even more stressful, the strategic community partners stuff, I feel like there are rhings of programs I've done that I've just wiped from My Memory ..I remember running in the snow!! The period of working on manifest plus at durfee and getting the big pizzas and having Stephen and that other dude be in the room there too, and when I got my nsw phone I was just in awe of everything it could do. Viewing the murmuration of starlings is still one of my biggest highlights and that walk was one of the nicest ones, I remember shooting the pictures and looking for blue jays and northern cardinals in the snow!!! I remember the draammmmmaaaa of Betty la fea, always so palpable. I remember checking for abs cause michael had abs and I was jealous, and I also remember wearing super tight underwear that made peeing hurt and me thinking I had an STD 😭..I remember the debate and also very strongly the spelling bee and the dang word INFAMOUS which I spelled as infirmary because of the dudes accent, which sucked harddddd and the other dude getting the word panache right 😭, I don't even remember his name. I also remember shopright and fun place, and it's wild cause fun place is such an esoteric place idk how they found out about it, but I remmeber my 10th birthday where we first went to ShopRite and like, bought cake, and idk if everything looked so big because I was so small or whether it really was big, then we went to the beach which was amazing, I have vague memories of another beach with a very very steep slope before you get to the water and I was scared to fall so I staydd up till I decided to go down and found out it wasn't bad, and there was also a ferris wheel there that I remember my brother saying he could see London BUT IDK IF THST WAS A DREAM OR A MEMORY.  I remember grading exams for mr lanre? I think, and I remember sometimes I'd be able to see other people's exam scores before it was out and we'd tally each other's exam score, omg the waittingggg to see the scores was always so painful but so satisfying at the end, and I remember my nickname of champion, professor  and my dad giving me 300 naira for getting 3rd place that one time in primary 5 which I WASNT EXPECTING AT ALL

Quite happy with how it turned out so let's keep the momentum.going. UDM.has a quest 3! Ugh I feel like if I had nothing to do I could propose ideas that would be really cool to work on :(..Anyways tho, my sleep has been terrible these past few days, just waking up randomly to pee and not being able to get into any dreams brfore I just wake back up. Next week is fall getaway and the weather is already getting cooool, I racked in a total of an hour 30 mins of cardio this week! I'm kinda iffed cause it's not something I can do and see immediate progress or even really know if I am progressing, my shins still hurt btw, but it's something I'm gonna keep doing and I still need to do the 3 days a week program...Anyways, had the seed meeting resume thing which was good, asked dr Hill some questions, chilled in lab after. FORGOT ABRAHAM'S NAME, HIS NAME IS ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM, A B R A H A M. Anyways, it's cool, I'm liking dressing nice,.makes me feel more confident and also gets me attention which I can't lie is white nice, especially since now I'm building that reputation. It's all good tho;

    Entry: Omg I'm gonna take note of this memory, in Cru a memory got sparked of when there was the vicsum marathon and I was so tired and saw joy in front of me and asked her how she was doing so well as I was panting and she was like, its God and I 1000 percent forgot that ever happened but the memories just came back 😭😭 I loved doing the memory day so much that whenever I think of an old memory I want to jot it down. I can honestly do something similar rn but I wanna talk about how I'm feeling..I'm definitely feeling much better than I was yesterday, didn't have a good sleep tbh and kept waking up thinking I peed the bed for some reason but it was just sweat. I got more self conscious about my conversational skills today than in a very long time. Like I started thinking about whether I was just focusing on myself alone, and cringing at my admittal of speaking Spanish, which sucks, but at least it's not something I'm letting myself dwell on ..Something funny happened, Albert called me cause he had a programming problem he needed help with, and at first I thought it was a scam but something led me to pick it up and it was him, and I helped him on his project which was nice, and he seems to be really excited about game design which is also really nice. ..I didn't lock in hard today but I did some studying for networking, met with Mike, finished the networking lab, which was all great, and also got time to watch some of cruella, absolutely amazing movie so far. Andre and Ben's team are already in a sort of conflict which hopefully they work out, I am admittedly glad that it's not something I have to deal with and I'm enjoying working with Ethan. okay im getting sups tired so gonna head to bed. The weekend is almost herengee

Like at this point there are things I do that make me feel like I've lost control of my thoughts, which sucks, cause like, I'm trying to focus on and think that the shame doesn't solve any problems but at this point shame is really all I can feel/want to feel ..I also think there's something wrong in my stomach but idk, maybe my bladder is strained or something. Anyways yeah idk why I feel like I'll never understand my thoughts or the reason I do the things I do. But then again I feel like I'm not making any real effort...I haven't consistently read the Bible in a while, cru is really the only thing keeping me tethered to my faith so I'm just in a bad mood. And fall getaway is around the corner so there's that ;-;. ..Anyways tho, Karen hasn't reached back which, at least is giving me time to rest. I felt my body well up with stress once I mentioned that cause I'm imagining that Dr mina spoke with her or sth and now she's trying to see why I didnt get paid yet or sth, but idk, she hadn't responded before so I imagine she's busy, but she's still looking for students to do the data part of stuff so idk. I bicycled today, and had a dream where I understood an ASL finger spelling ..Ok I'm going to bed

    Entry: Played beat saber and quite enjoyed it . Went semi intense but not for too long, maybe 20 ish mins. Watching this video about thinking levels and I feel like I'm understanding or internalizing that everyone has different lives to live with different experiences and backgrounds and stuff. Idk just a thought, I was also wondering how different I would be if I didnt journal and I honestly can't say. ..Like, I feel like I have a general idea but I really don't know how different of a person I would've turned out to be. I do think, actually know, that this keeps me grounded and I think that part of me, the part of me I can feel a lot when I'm journalling, I think its still there csuse I journal? Maybe it even developed cause I journal, idk if this makes a lotta sense, well, it makes sense to me ..Anyways, we cooked on networking assignment and studied for a good while . Also watched the sonic the hedgehog 2 movie with my brother and it was really fun/funny, also watched a bit of samurai champloo which is good too. I'm gonna start asking myself more probing questions and actually think deeply.thorugh them

    Entry: Today wasn't so bad, or bad at all, I even drove! With minimal issues and I earned myself the badge of being able to go to everyday foods on my own!! We'll see how it goes, car still pending...Gonna make this entry as sequential as possible, haven't talked with Dan in a while and idk why I feel like he's mad at me, but I really wanna set up a meeting with him and keep playing V rising lol. I spent essentially all of today on some kind of work, either image processing or networking. Got good work on both and gonna turn in and finish them tomorrow, so that's nice ..We got dunkin donuts, took me too long to figure out how to spell that,so that was nice. Started watching 86 which was pretty good. Also I had a dream about central and it was surprisingly detailed. Anyways, just finished my elevate, back to my entry..Ethan went on a date! His relationship blossoms. I do feel happy for him, but I also feel like, not sure how to describe it, like wondering whether I'll ever experience anything like that, or like be able to talk to someone for hours and enjoy their company, idk idk. I'll email Yvonne and kammie tomorrow ..No more mind on relationships!!! Yeah today kinda flew by and it was 5pm before I knew it. Sent emails, one to Dean Snyder and one to Its. Also idk if I mentioned that I'm now in the masters program, prolly did. Oh well I guess I'll use this opportunity to just.spill everything lm like pretty sure I saw the outline of lukases no no zone - I love and hate how I can't still fully express myself as I'd want, but yeah, and idk it made me react weird, it was weird, the entire situation was weird, it reminds me of middle school where everyone was raving about abs and hitting puberty and I remember flexing my hardest to see if any abs will show up. Funnily enough I don't think I've ever mentioned that here, there are a lot of memories I haven't mentioned here but honestly like I've already gone this far so what's the harm, most of them are going to be weird tho, maybe this is the kind of thing I'll be talking with a future partner about. ANYWAYS,..I remember finding that sex Ed booklet thingy in the briefcase and it was my little secret, honestly even as a kid I was more interested in the male genitalia, omg that sounds so weird, BUT ITS TRUE, like it's kinda all I knew so it's all I was interested in, I remember that one comedy video with the cartoons and the bust and he squeezed the dudes balls and it showed cracked eggs and I watched that too many times! And even asking Femi about it, and like, spending the night with the dictionary and looking up words related to everything about it in the dictionary by the candle. It's one of my most vivid memories from that time period tbh. ..I still remember kameerah, I think, I remember feeling like I had a thing for her but we hung out a lot, or, a lot in terms of like the three memories I remember, with the stinky feel swing rhyme song thingy, I still don't know how that stuck with me and now I'm smiling for no reason and now feel weird. But like, I remember when Anslem used to catch bugs and release them on D something, I don't remember her name, dinma? And I also got fascinated or roped into being interested about spiders, and I remember when he stole the tablet and Mr Samuel had to report him, and abiola and the other girls were singing that one song to try to calm her down and make her not beat him whole Sola and I were sitting in that one sit and like laughing but also singing? Nah I think we were mostly laughing ..I remember when it was someone's birthday or something along the lines but there were a lot of things going on and I started feeling overwhelmed and I think started crying or just put my head down and people thought someone used their umbrella to hit me..I remember jimmy, JIMMY, I think was his name lol, I'm pretty sure it was, but I remember him pouring water on me and me getting so angry at it, and others were like, it's just water. It still happens when my brother splashes water on me and I feel that too. I also remember him doing the fake fart sound and then I got in trouble for it even after he knew it was him, and I think, well I don't remember the scenario, but it was Ifes birthday I think and we had an exam or quiz or something and she said I was cheating and I honestly don't remember if I was but I remember people being like, omg his eyes is red, after I was crying from being beaten I assume, but then she let me go out and pass out cake pieces with ife, or someone else I don't remember...I remember ife adegbulugbe, he's got a monkey in his brain, and our weird dance and me taking his breakfast and I can still taste the bread and the jelly, idk if I was a bully 😭..I remember the twins that could do splits and falling on the stairs things because I didn't tie my shoes after being told to do so, then being taught to tie my shoes there and that's how I've always tied my shoes. I remember going to CBD for award ceremonies and repeatedly almost getting lost because of how big the building was. OMG I REMEMBER SHAWNNNNA, HE Wore big glasses and I think he started copying me biting my nails, I completely forgot he existed omg. ..I remember getting art awards that were always just random books and my parents telling me that they were pretty much useless. I remember people trashing on Mofi for his birthday pack being bad and only having like a pencil and eraser and I feel really bad for him, but I'm pretty sure his next one was much better. He had a kind heart, I remember Thaddeus and the other people from the other classes having their PSPs and playing mortal Kombat and I remember a time where we were hiding from the headboys or something and my brother was also there. ..I remember when the Chibok girls were kidnapped and instead of having a celebration of something, they kinda told us all about it and it felt pretty sad but also far away, kinda.like it does now. I remember being very young and at the school party where the sewage system broke and people fell in and I'm thinking a Chelsea's mom was also part of them. Everywhere smelled and we were asked to go inside...I remember the summer thing at Trinity school, and watching Avatar the last airbenders around that time as well at temis shop, I remember just using the answers on the cover even though I knew they were wrong jist because I wanted to get out and play csuse others wrre already leaving. I remember waiting and being so bored when pelumi was in school and we'd ask to play with him and use his phone to play killer bean or watch movies, and I remember when he called me his F1, as in favorite one, it was so random but it felt nice.  I remember Stanley! And also randomly when temi got a cat, and when her mum beat her because she said we were just a family that buys on credit, I felt so bad for her. Ugh so many memories omg, I gotta do this again, it's like unlocking sections of my brain that I didn't even know had been locked. I haven't even touched on vicsum yet and I still have so much to say there. I hope this at least immortalizes ghese memories somewhere. I got so sidetracked from my original entry but I liked this a lot ..I didn't even feel bad nostalgia once!!!

    Entry: All I'm thinking in my head is, this ain't it. Like I feel like I'm living two lives, especially the more I let other people's comments about me get to me. Like I think again, it's that feeling of like, my inner self taking a step back? Idek what I'm saying or talking about, maybe I'm thinking the tiredness is my inner self , idek :-:. Anyways, I didn't go to bar b Cru, the meeting with James and the other vitain peeps went well, was good fun. .But also I just can't, there are things I need to process

    Entry: I feel like a fraud! Like, I feel like I'm not as intelligent as other people think I am, but idk why recently it feels to be brought up more and more and it just kinda messes me up. Like I think some of it comes from image processing, like, I feel like I overly compare myself to Evan cause I want to know how I stack up.and whether I'm just blown out of the water. Like in the past 2 days Ethan has called me a genius, Mike commented about me being higher on the intelligence spectrum and safest was saying sth similar when we were working on the nafea work. And I was like, thinking about it yesterday too, ugh idkk. If I think too much about it, I feel like I'd be sabotaging myself or not cutting myself enough slack, but I'm not even letting it get to my head but idk if it actually is, and just subconsciously, idk 😭😭..I'm just happy that I'm having a slow down in my schedule. But I brought up to Dr mina that I was still working with Karen and she said she had a meeting with her tomorrow, which is weird cause idk why they'd be having meetings then, but yeah the payment stuff is definitely gonna come up again and is something that I may have to confront, but this time, the freakout is not long, like, I'd forget about it, then remember, kinda kick myself in the shine, and we move on. ..I said I was going to ask her about it cause I don't want to run away from my problems and not get what I deserve, but no more weak kneed weakness. We move strong! We answer questions, RAAH,she said all the documents were sent so we'll see whether she has a response and I'll ask Dr mina on Tuesday or sth, Karen hasn't responded but she'll prolly send an email for planning the next meeting based on the document I sent. So at least I'll get a response and know why I haven't gotten paid, and then I can use that towards my master's which Dr mina even said was good. Ok no more thinking about this. I thinkkkkkk I'm gonna play beat saber cause I didn't work out, but I think I was gonna say something else. Gonna work on networking hw and studying too

    Entry: The harvest moon is shining - super Moon, and I'm listening to shine on harvest moon headed home, and CRU went amazingly, met someone named Arya who is still super cool and bible studied guy and now I'm more motivated to do Bible studies and read my Bible and stuff because there were so many people at CRU! And like, they were participating and having so many good points and I'm so happy, and originally I was happy for CRU but then I remembered Abbie talking about how we are doing it for God and i just did a lil thanking prayer for him providing and allowing those people to come and learn..And now I'm feeling slightly more overwhelmed because I first wanted to skip the Bible study to study for image processing but decided not to, came pretty late tho, but even got one of the LSTMs models running, which was great! So there is a lot to be thankful about, and I don't have to be on campus early tomorrow so I'm going to focus on studying for networking and CVIP..Omg and even tonight, or technically last night, I wanted to get water but drank apple cidar vinegar - I think - instead, and it was terrible, but I had such a high quality/vivid dream with like, a decent plot? It was all neon and It was also somehow in the jjk universe and I was teleporting and junk, it's making me have wanted to keep focusing on lucid dreaming, but I'm getting so side tracked. Yeah I'm feeling pretty good. Even worked out!

Now I'm feeling much better, not out of the woods yet but we getting there, gotta text Dan about moving the meetings to in the week, which BAM JUST DID. Gonna do the masters document when I get home, cause BAM. Didn't get the chance to work out but gonna do beat saber at home, more cardio!!! And full moon too, felt super productive woo!..Guess how Cru went, GREAT, like we got a lot of people and good interactions, I also found someone who listens to good kid??? And Steven universe love like you! Like I wasn't expecting that at alllll, it was a very pleasant surprise. Now on our way home, and I have a headache but it's not too bad.

    Entry: Yes yes I know it's Tuesday but there are some things I wanna say, one, I really really dislike being around Ben now, like, I feel uncomfortable, I don't want him partaking in the same activities that I am - he stopped by chalk and talk for a second and I didn't enjoy the few minutes he was there, and like, I don't think I've talked to him one on one this semester - I want to continue as "which is fine " but it's not really fine, as even if I like, pretend we are in the same boat as me and Lukas, at least I don't hate Lukas being around me and would like for him to do some of the stuff i do. But that's not nearly the case for Ben and I don't wanna bring it up to either Ethan or Andre. I think I'll talk to Ethan about it, but just acknowledging him sometimes just sucks. And I think it's even worse that idk how he feels about me cause now it makes it even harder for me to.gauge how to respond euchhhhhh..In beter news od story, I cycled today for zone 2 cardio, jumping ropes still.hurting my shin and if hasn't healed yet so I'm focusing on bicycling, omg doing soccer made me feel the pain of being out of shape like crazy, like I thought I was pushing myself hard with cardio but I was literally wheezing like when I used to do track, and I don't think my mental toughness is at the level that it was then, but that definitely brought back some memories...I'm also ricing my Linux mint and liking it so far, even downloaded the i3 Window tiling manager and it looks pretty interesting, it'll def be fun to learn how to use it well so I might not even use X11, the one I was spending time ricing xd, omg.i wonder if that's why hyprland never worked on nix,I was still on the old tiling manager and.never switched????? Maybe perhaps. Not very demure of me

I'll detail more later, in the lab now, also finished the chalk and talk which was great to see, it was like mainly freshmen which was so amazing , I'm so hyped to see the freshmen taking initiative and I pray they grow more and more in their faith because of it. ..I got work to do, a lotta work so I gotta lock in ciao!!

    Entry: No church today so pretty much had the typical Sunday, ironing while watching anime - watched a bit of yons of the dawn and it wasn't very good, potatoes and egg, pizza, some work, some gaming, this time asgards wrath which was pretty fun, I'm getting better at fighting as the new character and just exploring the world. washed my hair today and also made two big choices, which, dang ..1st choice, I've known and have said to myself many times that I'll start focusing on cardio but I never do. So this time I'm actually doing it, built into my program from the beginning. Starting workouts with jumping ropes for 15 minutes and another 15 minutes running on the track, then my normal workouts are cut short with only the essential movements, still focusing on legs and back but training for strength predominantly on the big movements, so heavy bench squat Romanian deads, moderate accessories etc, but much less accessories...Stopped procrastinating on the LM document and started thinking about how to actually implement the changes. BUT Im getting sidetracked ..Second big decision is, IM DOING A MASTERS. I haven't told Ethan or Andre yet, idk when I will, probably after I sign up, but like, idk Im not overthinking it, I just feel like I should, like it's the right thing to do. It's totally not me wanting to spend another year at the comfort of college life XP. Whateverree, God willing I'll have a masters at 20 which I think is pretty cool 😤😤. ..If udm offers me the role of a professor that'd be hilarious, but it'd be sick, itll be like, we've seen how your tech is changing udm, would you like a role as an assistant professor, and I'll be teaching students older than me 😭😭, that'd be something. A man can daydream!..Okay okay what else, I'm feeling quite tired and have a nine am class tomorrow so I'll head to bed. Gotta get my sleep right. So yeah I think today will be a milestone day, decided to go for a masters! And heres to great heart health!!

    Entry: Kinda crushed it today, kinda. Like, started the day with laundry ofc, but also working on the study of drama project which was cool, finished it, AND THE MAKEUP one, it was hilarious, I noticed that my mum was watching a YouTube video on how to do it and she was laughing so much. Also my phone screen is like, still keeping up, if the brightness goes up enough, the problem disappears and actually stays disappeared so maybe I just keep it like this and hope it doesn't change. I gotta brush my teeth and drink water blech, but yeah I finished the diorama and did makeup for the first time ever 😂 ..Also did image processing homework, at least completed it, and read on networking SMTP and http stuff which is always nice. Didn't set up mint even though I planned to and honestly I've been slacking on Legalmeasure so I gotta actually lock in tomorrow. My schedule is clearing up as I'm completing the tasks which is niceeee ..Hmm what else, idk today was a chill day, gotta ask my dad about the car tomorrow. Tomorrows also a wash day woo, my hair been curling but I think I gotta manually curl some to get the process started...Anyways time to end the day. Also, well, I might chat longer. At the end of the day It ended up being just me and Ethan on reimbursement project which is BEST CASE SCENARIO WOO. I'm looking forward to it and hope I don't slack too much. Also gotta not slack at CRU and planning stuff, but ..For networking I actually have to lock in and focus. I notice Dr Utayba focuses a lot on me and often walks toward my direction when explaining stuff - it's not something I like, started wanting to notice but when I did I couldn't stop noticing the eye contact and I KNOWWWW its not just in my head ..But now that I know that, it's getting too my head and idk how to just like, unnotice or forget stuff that boost my ego to stop making it be part of my identity? I gotta call it sth else, like when something becomes so important to me that I start to panic when I feel like I'm losing it? Using panic loosely. That just reminded me my brother showed me a jubilee video that was so triggering and annoying but also in a funny way

    Entry: Doing image processing now, at least I'm happy I'm getting it out of the way. I had a not good time with trying to set up windows and it took so much time out of my day and there were issues with the bootloader which sucked hard but thank God I just loaded into a new mint and I can access all my files so it's not really a big deal, just gotta install stuff. Still have to contact Razer about my battery :-: ..My phone screen is still bugging and acting normally sometimes and acting alll weird other times. It's already tomorrow. The past few nights have felt like they move so slowly, mostly cause I wake up in the middle and stay awake for honestly like 30 mins but I usually just forget how long Im laying in bed with my thoughts...Anyways, I have to like, temper my ego and the things that I start noticing and overvaluing, idk if it's something to go over now but like, yeah I gotta watch out for it .I also played volleyball today and my shins HURTT

    Entry: Yes yes ok I'm late and my bonnet is wet cause beat saber, I wanted to finish booting windows into the new drive but the laptop kept frickin overheating and at this point I think I'm done with windows, it's just not gonna work out ;-;, at least until I find some better way to do it. I' am up pretty late which sucks cause 10sm class tomorrow blech, I'll survive tho. My screen got better like, it was working normally for a few minutes but now I think it got worse 😭. Like doing the finger print scanner made it better then it made it worse. My dad picked me up today and he talked about doing a master's in GIS, or geomatic engineering, should've asked more questions but I might've just made the decision to do a masters. Idk yet tho 😭😭, I think I'm gonna do it but I'm like, still climbing down the fence so I haven't jumped off it yet...Anyways, did my hair today, the curls are getting stronger but mainly at the base, which I suppose is fine, they're getting tight. I also played beat saber and it was fun and intense and I got a side stitch! 😭 Anyways gonna do some quick searching about how to boot into windows and then knock out, ciaoo

    Entry: Just got back from Wednesday Cru and headed home now. Ate a ton of food yeesh. Today was a good day tho, I was just thinking of memories like, the kind of memories where you just get teleported there, like me and Eyitooni playing call of duty or my mum making the cookies close to Christmas, or playing elemental battlegrounds that one night or walking and seeing the murmuration of starlings. Its just wild, but I was thinking about how these memories feel more and more distant as time passes by, which is something I found harder to admit at first but now I just kinda have to accept it, cause I'm listening to local void and just going back to me in vr with the lights and it felt like one of those memories and it's what sparked that thought..But then it just made me want to start actually making those kinds of memories. Like nothing is stopping me from baking Christmas cookies for everyone, and I guess I don't control those memories - even like early last summer with the yoga, natural hypertrophy, home alone combo but yeah I just wanted to say that I think I'll start making an active effort to figure out how to trigger and make those memories. ..I was able to work in that room in CASEE and I honestly did that cause I was uncomfortable being around Ben but it turned out to be a nice productive zone. I cranked out co op and symbolic logic assignment and watched this video about sky and the original idea and art is so beautiful and like, it just fills me with something I dont think I feel elsewhere...Even had the meeting with Dr Hill which was very productive! And didn't work out but i jump roped, for like, 13 mins In like 30 mins and my shins are gonna hate me tmmw

Nothing I can't manage and thank God rn dr hills work is the only.One that's struggling. I talked with Dr mina today and let her know about tuition remission, and me not being able to get paid with paylocity which was great, she has a new project that looks interesting but idk fully. ..Didn't get my screen repaired cause it's flipping expensive, 300 dollars for an original display is wildd. 125 ish for an old one is even wilder. Dang one of those people was probably expecting me to come in but I didn't, aw dang now I feel slightly bad :(. Cru was good, we got some new faces.christiaj also left his water bottle so I'm holding it for him. Anyways I'm off to bed now, there's some more stuff I wanna say, but 9am class.tomorrow ughhh

Read networking chapter, did the LD ibt changes, even had a call with Karen and John that went well I think, I gotta make a document and stuff to see how we could solve a problem that's honestly pretty interesting so we'll see how it goes. ..Hmm what else, that's kinda about it, going to phone repair place tomorrow,didn't workout today so I gotta do 4 consecutive days today again. Ok I'm off to bed now, ciaoo ..Drama class was fun and some random people barged in and started saying rubbish😭, I recorded one of them

    Entry: Okay so, I could put today in great, I didn't lock in hard, slightly.locked in, I turned in networking assignment, yay, and finished the image processing onramp which was slightly confusing but I learned more about images and functions like fspecial and structuring elements, which was cool. Highlight was definitely going to Golden corral, there were people from central there which was holarioouss, the food wasn't the best, but it was aight, im in a very privileged position to say that and I do recognize that. They had this yeast bread that was DIVINEEEEE. ..Now it's kinda pretty late and I should def head to bed cause early class but here I am, also, my phone screen, the bottom half, has gone on the fritz which sucks, but thank God it works and apart from the visual mess, it doesn't impede how I use my phone much and typing honestly is still super smooth, maybe smoother than before. I still have the image processing homework to finish and the second reading assignment, I was also planning on reading for networking but I think/Ill have to focus on it over the week, including working on the changes Shivani emailed about, which I'll get by Monday, since apart from study of drama, I have a pretty good amount of free time. I'm def more productive on campus than I am in person, so as long as no one is in my zone area, I'll be fine, and if they are, ill go to the library and enter the zone there. ..I finished bojack horseman today!! It was a wild ride but dang that show was really well done! Oh we also went to my mum's workplace and looking at the people there had me thinking about how they perceived the world, it's kinda wild. Also we just saw a rat loll, well I guess my mum just saw a rat. My younger brother is also sick and I think it's getting to me, I gotta drink more of my water r😭🥹. Also random thought, being at Golden corral made me think of how each person there had their own unique lives and sonder and stuff, but then even in that, I realized that there's a difference in thinking it versus feeling it. ..Also I have to admit that I have a growing problem and I've been trying to deal with it myself but I need to bring God into it, speaking of God aleggs is getting more and more religious which is great to see, and now I gotta catch up and stop being a lil wuss. Anyways gonna brush my teeth and head for bed now, ciao ciao. ALSO OTS GETTING COLD. Also car shopping still going

    Entry: I've been feeling more out of touch than usual, I'm like, concerned about being.too busy but at the same time I feel like I'm not busy at all? I was working on networking and image processing assignment, both of which were quite complex, especially image processing and I'm feeling especially cooked, but nothing's impossible to learn so I have to take things slowly...Sarwar worked on our joint report which was perfect, don't have much more to say, Golden corral tomorrow woo! (Strained excitement)

Whenever someone says I'm busy, I get annoyed and start overthinking my workload but whatever, I should be sleeping by now

Also made progress on both Dr Paulik assignment which thank God, and started networking assignment, I feel like I'm fairly busy but like a right amount of busy, still drinking water, and yeah idk what more to say lol. ..I'm realizing more and more that I'm getting to know a lot more people on campus. My legs are sore and I'm pretty tired so I'll go pucker out. Nice birthday, I'd rate it but I'm not gonna rate a day. I should've bought myself cake or sth

    Entry: Tomorrow is.ma birthdayyyy, funnn , today was honestly fun, and I ate a lot, and worked out my brain towards the end. Highlight of the day was definitely playing badminton with sarwar, I went from 12 - 4 to winning the game at 15 14!! It was a ton of fun and reminded me how much fun sports with others was, especially once it gets competitive. Even thinking of joining badminton practice/,team after lab..We met with Dr nafea and told him the good news which he seemed to enjoy a lot, anyways, it was cool, he gave a mini lecture on resnets and I gotta get back into attention mechanisms and the like. I have to go to Dr tosins office tomorrow blegch, from like 12 to something, yeah doiuble blech, but ill prolly be the only one at home once i get back which is a plus, ive been watching hit monkey and its surprisingly super entertaining. Solar opposites too. I'm also trying to learn even more signs cause I don't want Ethan to leave me in the dust..Doing the image processing assignment made me think and work on the muscle that has me redoing what I did again and again to make sure that me solving it wasn't a fluke. Like when I saw chat gpts solution, I was like nah this can't be right, it looked too complicated but doing it myself and seeing how and why they made the choices they did, and just going piece by piece helped tremendously! I'm gonna do networking homework tomorrow, chapter 2 reading, and then do the gradient part, so this should be fun!..Also went to Andres dorm and Wednesday Cru. 19 is gonna be the start of big changes I'm sticking to! As long as I don't overthink it, from now till fall getaway and beyond. I can do this!!! Also I'm still nervous about the whole class switch dealy since if I'm not able to actually drop the class and it doesn't show up on my degree eval, I might be messing myself up

    Entry: Could've been higher, honestly not much that would've made the day higher but there was one thing that reduced the quality of it. But before that, the big stuff, I SWITCHED FROM WEB DESIGN TO COMPUTER VISION AND IM KINDA EXCITED BUT ALSO SCARED FOR A CLASS IN A WAY I HAVENT BEEN IN A LONG TIME. ..Ok so, Dr mina approached me saying she talked to avishek and that if I could substitute, and I had to do it today because the deadline had passed literally yesterday 🥲, and it was kinda wild cause it was technically not supposed to be able to work but I think they could make it work? We'll see. Anyways I'm taking the class with Evan and Michael and a bunch more Chinese students so it looks like it'll be fun, maybe I could even break into their social circle loll. TWO DAYS TILL MY FREAKING BIRTHDAY, it feels like I care less about it, which tbh is true and it's more of an after thought but still I'm excited! GONNA BE 19 WOO! ..Oh for the thing that brought it down, Dr mina said she wanted to talk with Dr Utayba about paying me and trying to get something sorted out, she's so freaking nice, but maybe to my detriment lol, I'm planning on stopping by her office tomorrow or Thursday and telling her my parents said we should wait till they sort out everything and I don't mind waiting. It'll be chill, God willing it will be chill. Dude the shame I often feel after you know what is so annoying and sucks cause I feel so guilty about doing anything christianly or calling on God which I know I shouldn't be but geeeeez. It's also getting later and I should/must start heading to bed, I will after this entry which may be longer than I thought, but whatever, we got our meeting with Dr nafea tomorrow, it should be good, we at least have good news for him ..I have a plan for computer vision, gonna do the onramp things to get up to speed on Matlab and honestly it's already helping, like I'm learning a bunch about how everything is an array and learning to index with () instead of [] is weird but I'm getting used to it/will get used to it. I will eventually contact Karen but for now I'm buzzzeyyyyy. We'll see, I'll keep working on onramp tomorrow since I have a heck ton of free time thank God.

    Entry: Roller coaster ish week but laundry took sooo flipping long, and it's also hot and I didn't drink enough water 😭 and my legs are soooore and I woke up pretty grumpy and tomorrow is the driving practice and my dad hasn't started helping me look for cars BUT..I registered for FALL GETAWAY WÓOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, I still had a 50.dollar gift card I forgot about thank God, so yay! Also gotta get my SSD from Daniel, haven't dermarolled in a while and I gotta keep watching bojack but I watched this beautifully animated show called Wands and wistoria and it was really good mainly cause of animation ..But yeah I'm finally ready to talk about more semester shenanigans, Ben's now, OH CRAP today's his bday? Either yesterday or today, but I guess he doesn't like it being celebrated  so idk? Yeah today is his bday, checked last year's calendar lol. But yeah he's talking semi normally with me ig but like, that's not what I wanted? Like I don't want us to just move past it, but then again I'm not making any moves to actually do anything, so this might even be the best case scenario, but it just doesn't feel right, and then there's Andre who idk where I stand with anymore, we still laugh and stuff, but like, being alone with him just makes me wanna leave and do something else compared to like being along with Ethan or sarwar. It's like me and Lukas, which idek, but then again I don't make any effort with most of those on the outside so like, whatever? This is so, not unproductive, but leading towards no solution..Well, maybe there's no Problem and I'm just looking for some? Ugh idk idk. I gotta work on keeping my ego in check tho. Also, gotta go to bed, also phone screen being annoying

Like SHEESH, WE JUST HAD TO LET IT RUN THROUGH THE EPOCH, I gotta see what the difference between epochs and batches are but still! ..Had a great workout and I've been getting praised a lot for my style BUT I feel like it's gonna go so up in my head and it's gonna become a part of my identity in an unhealthy way but that's totally for future me. Then I also had a meeting with Tehani that went amazingly with some changes that I could do pretty quickly - and also get the chance to perfect or at least make the code better..Was also quite productive and turned in drama, ethics and web dev assignment, remaining senior design which blech, this week feels like it has been moving pretty slowly but like, kinda in a good way. I feel like I'm back in the flow and idk if drinking water is making me feel so energized or just like being around people that make me feel good!!

The event went swimmingly and now Im in lab about to work on Dr nafeas work, got a good more to say but I'm gonna get coding now..Edit, ..Just got home and gotta get straight to work, didn't drink as much water today and feeling less energized, but I also socialized a lot more so idk if it cancels out, prolly should get sth to drink, also didn't eat a ton, but ate like, a fish thing at Tdr, that idk whether it was supposed to be undercooked salmon or sth, but it was COLD, so, yeah, idk, also my stomach has been feeling weird but it's gotten better..Asked my dad to help me look for a car and I'm gonna be looking for cheap cars too. It rained a bunch today, and one of our plug thingys stopped working, fun, I guess the fridge doesn't work but I think it's just partial

Funnn, it's quite dark, which is funny cause yesterday I was just wondering how dark the room would be if the dang Cass center place didn't have their huge billboard, and now I know :), it's gonna be super hot and I know I'm gonna be sweating a ton, fun! I was planning on getting more work done but in the spirit of fixing my sleep schedule, even though I spent like, 30 mins to an hour probably just lying in bed with my thoughts cause I couldn't fall back asleep but it was still dark. Well, I'm prolly gonna read till the urge to fall asleep hits me. ..Oh something I forgot to mention is that I've somehow started subconsciously placing high value on my tims management skills, and when my mum had like challenged it earlier cause of vacuuming stuff, it got me quite ticked but it brought me to this realization...Anyways, today is tomorrows yesterday!

    Entry: Today was chill, I feel like I've been thinking a lot, like, just thinking in my head about why I do what I do, etc etc, my younger brother got cornrows lol, but yeah web technology Is probably gonna be very boring, not as fun as I kinda wanted, I still gotta email Dr Olla cause he said he has data that we could use and I am curious cause I think he is gonna like rocket my AI in healthcare path, which honestly I can see myself doing that as a path , but I have to ask my parents actually if it's possible for me to do a PhD or master's ..Kinda hectic and moving day but I don't mind, I've been thinking like, I think I'll get the opportunity to place as much focus in the classes as I would've liked to do last semester and that's pretty freeing, but I also don't wanna hold on to that too much or misuse my time just because I wanna spend more time on like a study of drama homework or sth, which I'm like, looking to finish tonight. I'll also have to look at the due date for the co op assignment, already started but didn't finish, finished the reading tho which is nice. .I had a terrible stomach ache today, TERRRRIBLE stomach ache, used the bathroom in school twice! TWICE, once in Dr minas class lol, now that I've kinda seen how this semester is going, I think I'm ready, I also have to email Molly, and even though I feel like I should be overwhelmed, I'm not really, I'm whelmed, and I just have to make sure not to overthink or overstress, also I think drinking water from my juggernaut bottle has been doing me good, idk if irs placebo but I feel more energetic like throughout the day, even now, and I no longer like, well I can't say for a fact, but Im not feeling that like mid afternoon slag or ..Drain, which is super nice. After this, gotta get all my textbooks in order, eat dinner, there's gonna be a call tonight for Cru so I think I'll do that, I'm still working on my schedule and stuff, gotta send a few emails, etc etc..I still haven't had a one on one with Ben and I don't know if we are gonna have like a big convo like that...butttt we'll see, I think day by day we are getting comfortable with each other more, but things are definitely changing. I don't know if I want to work on this AI in healthcare project with Andre, and if I do, I'll have to talk to him, cause Ethan's also tagging along and I know Ethan and can trust him to keep up with me, but I wanna go all out!

Anyways, thank God today went great! All the classes so far look chill, study of drama especially, and the beginnings of symbolic logic are boutta be so ez. Co op is more like busy work but I guess that's fine...Went to my lil spot but I much prefer it when it's cold, also the back of the chair was hurting my back :(, ITS ALSO SO HOT🥹🥹, I want summerr, anyways tho, worked out with my tank top and I felt so big! Also gym wasn't as filled which was great, drank a lotta water today, kinda had to, gotta up my water intake cause at home I just ignore all urges to drink water 😭😭, gonna be a good change I believe, bringing my chunky water bottle, I wonder what I can track to see the changes that it'll give me, we'll see how it goes. ..Anyways, Cru tomorrow, my mum said I can start asking my dad for a car! Cool!! Also fun classes tomorrow, I am really hyped for web technology mainly because I already have experience in it. Shine on harvest moon!

Tried some more hair products and idk if it's cause I just had the cut but I'm seeing much less breakage. ..Then I decided to iron a bunch of my outfits to anticipate the week, gonna be dropping some new outfit combos woo, looking forward to it tbh, then we had the Cru get together which was super fun, it was small and nice, we prayed, chatted, ate delish food. Even just told my mum about fall getaway, just ripping the bandaid and not overthinking is doing wonders, especially when it's a minute part of me that's like SAY IT and I just say it, going against my urges and desires, which I promise I'm gonna be doing much more of!..Even cleaned out my bag today, and I finished this anime called ID: Invaded on Hulu and .it was preeety good. Yeah also birthday is coming up yoo, 10 days is wild, I also gotta remember Ben's birthday, don't know if it's 30th or 31st. Yeah gonna go to bed early to get my sleep back on track, so goodnight!!

Don't have much to say, I did create a model! That did have 99 percent accuracy which honestly was kinda sus, but I learned some things about linear regression and it not using gradient descent with sklearn, could've been learning even much more if I tried learning just one thing over the summer but regrets shregrets. We got church tomorrow and maybe meeting with favor...I think I look better with short hair, but if I lost a bit more face fat, then like, that'd be the icing on top, so I'm thinking of going on a mini cut, the semester is starting and like, if I can perfect timing, so like intermittent fasting? Like a 14 hour fast? On Monday Wednesday and Fridays, work out right before eating and then head to Tdr after. Then I'll be free all day to Do ..A) Dr nafeas work, and other stuff I'll decide when the time comes, but I think we can make this work. I'm gonna start pestering my mum about a car, I want slash NEED to get better at it and learn to move around on my own ..My brains in a feisty mood tonight just creating fighting scenarios over the fall getaway timing - Oct 4 to 6, to getting s car, So I'm just gonna sleep now, also FIX SLEEO SCHEDULE

    Entry: Today was cool, feeling a bit sick tho, like, stomach achey and wanna use the bathroom-y, went on a nostalgia trip, mostly a bad one, looking at my weird horny messages from last years and rn all I can really do is cringe, but I completely get my headspace back then, I'm listening to sky soundtrack and one of the playlists from the time where I was in the library a ton and kinda marked when it stopped feeling like my own cozy space, a sit by the water will always transport me there/then, trying to get work done but not really. ..Oh today I went on a shopping spree, online shopping spree of 200 dollars plus 40 for a haircut which I'll be getting tomorrow - going for the fade. Also got a leave in conditioner, shampoo and curling cream, looking forward to using it, planning on doing it all twice a week, Mondays and Thursdays, gonna start taking good care of my hair 😤😤...I'm contemplating going back to nostalgia some more, for some reason I can never find aironths messages,.I'm trying to remember a distinct conversation we've had. Omg I just stumbled on boof king lolll, also fall getaway is here again and I'm freaking looking forward to it, it's gonna be in October and Ethan's gonna be there too. Also I most likely feel sick cause I did have a lot to eat. Also did a tiny bit of self ML studying, I've been finding it fairly hard to just sit down and work on it, idk what I'm scared of but I'm scared of something, not finding good resources? Not being good enough? Maybe I just don't have a good structured learning environment, idk. Also gonna try to be more consistent with reading Proverbs. ..This is kinda even more disjointed but I watched.inside out 2, the sound track is really good and it even got me considering doing something in AI related to sound, also made spring rolls today, and something I startEd doing is dropping every thought of work when I'm cooking and it has honestly made the entire process much more enjoyable. Also told my mum about the Cru welcome back dinner on Sunday

That's about it for me honestly . Gonna be getting back into the working out routine and I can't wait. Gyms gonna start being pretty full tho, whatever. HA ITS Already FRIDAY, just like I predicted, lol bruh, but like, it's essentially already Friday and then in no days we'll be back learninggg.

    Entry: Today was honestly quite productive, like, started the day with my new morning routine of Duolingo, elevate, asl learning, then went into Dr Hill stuff till mid ish afternoon at like 2. Made some progress, even got a much better understanding of the FSM GUI from reading my documentation + the other ones in the past, so that's always nice, I'm planning on going from scratch and moving from GUI to Matlab to simulation, which should be quite comprehensive, and will double help me make sure everything is in order, planning on recording it all as well as like a walkthrough, got the slam stuff in the new folder, so it's all looking nice, even made it so the map yaml and world file can be passed into it, I think it'll be super helpful ..It's already moving to halfway to the week 🥹🥹, classes are comingg. Speaking of which, spoke to Dr nafea and he really is coming out to be a really good mentor and I thank God for everyone he has put in my path, literally just today as well Daniel got me a 1 or 2tb hard drive, looking forward to replacing windows on it! And I'll be able to download the mimic dataset woo! Or at least send it to myself, which would be amazing...Gotta figure out how to fix the truenas server, but yeah going back to Dr nafea, he supports us if we want to do ASL, which is great, but he still wants me to stick with one thing, and I'm + at least rn - really fascinated by the idea of doing research on a field and then creating technology that people will use based on that research, so essentially R and D, especially since seeing that one VR showcase which honestly stuck more with me than I thought - I was listening to this caravan palace mix and that's also stuck in my head lol. But one thing I'm definitely planning on, crap I lost my train of thought😭, Im gonna think more about whether I also really want to do the ASL stuff or stick with machine learning in healthcare, choices choices, so fun! It's like, I wasn't in an existential crisis just months ago :D...Gonna he'ad to bed now tho, peacee

Played baldurs gate again, and duuuuudeeee, I gotta understand my psyche/brain more, it's like, UGHHH, there's so much conflict up there, maybe I'm giving it too much credit, I get to control my brain! ..Dude, in like 5 years, God willing that I'm still here, I'm going to look at this thinking about how stupid I was for the things I worried about, hopefully because I've matured and not because much worse situations have happened. Today felt like, a day I could make choices, like, there was nothing I HAD to do, it was just me and all the things I wanted to make out of the day, even the coding club got cancelled and the kapor center event got rescheduled, so like, i didn't do too much work, made wheels spin in dental game, set up firebase in supplements which took so much longer than it should've, even worked a bit on dr Hill stuff, trying to get the ball rolling on cleaning things up, to questionable success, there's still a lot to do. Anyways tho, even watched shows and movies like watchmen - which tbh was pretty trash, and jackpot, which was also trash

    Entry: A long bg3 session tonight, from 9 to now essentially, not being very productive over the last few weeks but WHATEVER, as past me said, the quality of my day shall not be determined by my level of productivity 😤. Went driving to the everyday foods and honestly I was feeling pretty confident, but we had some hiccups, and I feel like her telling me like literally everything makes me feel less independent, but like, I know she doesn't mean any harm..Speaking of which, approaching things from the perspective of *did this person really mean harm to me or am I just perceiving that they did because it did do harm* has been quite helpful, I'm ready for this semester, I'm READYYYYY. Crap I gotta make a choice, PHD?? 😭😭😭. It kinda skipped my mind tbh, ughhhh, I'll do more in depth stuff tomorrow. Speaking of which, no meeting today thank Goddd, we didn't have much to show. Did laundry today and making a habit out of doing Ml Learning while doing the laundry is turning out to be pretty effective. The event at udm got cancelled so no going to campus tomorrow. This probably isn't going to be another long entry, I gotta drink more water, that's for 100 percent sure, and not only at night when I become super thirsty. CLASSES START IN A WEEK, am I hype? Maybe! Are there things I'm not looking forward to, maybeeee, do they really matter/will they matter in like 5 months, HECK NO, so let's get this breaddddd...I do wonder how our relationship is gonna change once we graduate, like, at that point we would really have lost one of our main ties - the school, workload, trashing on teachers etc, crap I just imagined myself on this same toilet seat after graduating and wondering where I go from there. That assumes I'll make it to Christmas - I keep saying this but I can now happily imagine myself then -, but still, I wonder what God has in store for us by the end of the year. To be honest, I am really looking forward to, and not praying enough for it, but like, the day when like, we get the letter in the mail saying that all our statuses have been upgraded and we are all fully green carded or something, I would be so freaking happy,.but alas, we live in the present and do what we can. It's getting quite late so I'm gonna head to bed..Also I'm thinking of heading back into learning ASL

    Entry: Today was quite busy but productive in a way that I guess I wasn't targeting. I started the day with making banana bread, because why not, I was planning on going to the driving school place and didn't wanna do any work before hand, so yeah - side note, I had a dream where I kept forgetting stuff at home before going to campus and it was surprisingly frustrating, even to me after I had woken up ..But yeah, found out we didn't have any flour left, so ground up oats and made me oat flour, which tbf was kinda genius, and it turned out pretty well, but I used too much banana and it was fairly mushy :(. ..Anyways tho, went to the driving school place,  but I had to make an appointment through cell, so that was a bust, but at least we got more info, and somehow my mum scheduled for me after I called, for September 1st but I'm looking to buy a car for before then 😭...Following that, went to the Apple academy thing, which, first thing, I DIDNT EXPECT DOWNTOWN TO BE SO CROWDED, like, I wanted to like hide and feel all out of place but I decided that no, I should walk like I belong, and I did :D and it all turned out fine, Richard, MS TILLMAN, Mr Akinfenwa, SHAE, VANITA AND KALISHA were all there, like whatttttt, it was wild, but also fun like, I talked to all of them, and I kept thinking that my smile mustve looked so fake, but like, I just kept on smiling, I also felt so tall, and Richard made a comment about how big I'd gotten loll..Talked to Ms Tillman too and I'm surprised she remembered me, ugh I really wanna go to central 😂🥹, maybe I'll get the chance to for Eyitoonis graduation, let's see if I make it till Christmas but things are looking on track, famous last words but I'm feeling hopeful, and like, actually looking forward to it, even more than my birthday, which crappp is in like 3 weeks, and classes start in like a week or two, so FUN. ..Didn't do any ML stuff really, very little reimbursement stuff, had a Cru meeting which was nice, we are planning big and pretty needed changes for next semester and I'm excited. Also got on a call with Ethan and he showed me this game he's working on for the dental school that's like Oregon trail inspired which is pretty sick, and I'm planning on helping out. Dang gotta do the supplements app stuff first tho. Anywayssss, tomorrow we get to workkk. All in all yeah today was eventful, that's how I'd put it. Even sat down for a while to watch alita battle agent -, gotta rewatch the final parts ..Speaking of Cru, even just meeting is making me like, start picking myself back up, faith wise, on campus I don't feel like I'll be 100 percent till I talk or like settle something with Ben, it's something I think I'll talk to Ethan about, just how to handle it all generally cause I don't need more awkward situations, blech it is what it is..Oh right I was gonna talk more about downtown, it felt so outside of my element, like, not my scene, and somehow I was brought back to the spot on campus,I wonder if future me would know The Spot, I'm gonna start calling it that lol, and like, that felt so much more like me, idk, maybe it's just the new environment, I'm sure I'd get to enjoy or even love the scene if I lived downtown ..Also my journals have been getting longer and more probing into my thoughts and mind, and I had another realization earlier but forgot lol, it'll show itself eventually

    Entry: Deleted then reinstalled brave ;-;, I feel like crap, again going back to yesterday's conversation, like, my mum was talking about washing whatever dishes were on there and it felt like the scab opened up again and I just shut down, and then had to make an active effort to not just brush off everything she's saying and I feel terrible and I feel terrible now just like, for the times where I let the ease take over me...And like, considering her POV, she's like, pretty much in the right but some part of my brain has wired criticisms and constant correction from her as like, idek, but as something that would make me want to rebel and do the opposite thing, or just stop entertaining her, which sucksss, im at least glad I'm noticing it but I know sometime in the future, probably near future, I'll feel very justified about being angry and closing off and then later come to realize I was being stupid..Anyways, went to school with sarwar, we worked on the ML part which was cool, and talked a bunch, but like, I still don't really know what I wanna do, I showed him LM and he thought it was really good, and I'm proud of it, notwithstanding the obvious issues during the process, which I have to talk to Dr mina after about the final pieces of the payment, we shall see how it goes...I'm planning on going to the driving place before the end of this week, and I also contacted ACSO, hooray..Also people's SSN got hacked or sth. Fun...Gonna follow my brother to the apple award thing tomorrow.

    Entry: Bojack horseman, crap, it's so weird, it has such good writing and characters and I feel like I need time to process it all 😭..I was so close to falling asleep earlier today, like, SO FLIPPING CLOSE, I was watching independence day as I was working on the reimbursement project..What the heck 😭 did Sarah Lynn just die in this episode, I love this show, but I alos gotta sleep..Also Eyitooni won the journi thing and there's gonna be an event thing on Thursday, but yeah thinking about the conversation from yesterday, and yeah I guess if I don't want to make any abrupt changes, I can slowly be starting from scratch? We'll see how it all turns out..Also won my first game of Go against Victor. Didn't go to the gym but played beat saber, and honestly, had a really fun time doing it, it felt good just like, letting loose on something I was good at? And because I wasn't feeling confident in a lot of other places, it felt nice to be able to come back to it and just feel in that comfort zone, and it's one thing I keep noticing, that the things I do that I think make me feel good, like scroll through shorts or just like watch a ton of shows or random stuff, don't actually make me feel good, they really just like, numb me? It's nothing really that I'll look back later in the day and be happy about, it's just a quick laugh or a mini dopamine hit, and not the same kind of joy I get from accomplishing something, like finishing a website project or seeing it come together nicely and being excited to work on it the next day again, and I've been thinking of what I can do to bring me back to that point, not that like, I. Really make any effort to just choose one thing, but more like, I just look at my tabs and see nothing that excites me or brings me.joy and I just go back to numbing myself...It all sounds very gloom and idk if it's BH that's bringing it out in my lol, in reality, its (probably) not as drastic as it sounds,but I cant go on like this. I make the excuse that it's the final days of summer break and I deserve to do all these things, but really they don't even make me feel, "good", so I may just be doing myself a disservice cause the idea of the outcome of all these things - mindless scrolling- is better and more rose tinted than the actual outcome of the action, and the idea of like the outcome of diving into Ml or VR technology is much more different in my head than it most likely will be in reality, with the outcome in my head being mainly negative and feeling like it will be a struggle x uphill battle. Which it probably will be, but I think the outcome will be much better compared to what I'm up to nowadays, much much better. ..And idk how much early summer is affecting this cause part of me also thinks like, well...all this could be over in a flash and I'm going to regret not just chilling, which might be true, but it might just be fake nostalgia regret, and me chilling just fades away from my memory in the span it took me to chill, like I'd chill for 4 hours and it's gone 4 hours later. And something I totally didn't hear from you know who was to like spend 2 hours a day focusing on what you love, and that's like genius, and like, 2 hours on what I love 2 hours on leisure is probably more balance than whatever schedule I have right now, 2 hours researching ML daily, 2 hours working on VR stuff daily, even 2 hours on a freaking personal project daily!and I feel like I'm failing at all that and can't even explain where the 12 hours in the day went. ..And I still feel the push back from making drastic changes, like part of me is like, it won't stick! Another part likes this mediocrity and comfort, another part is just scared of the change in routine, or better yet, the presence of one, maybe it reminds me too much of early summer, but this is going to do me so much more good than harm. ..Starting tomorrow, we go back to schedule!!!!!..One thing I can say is that I'm really looking forward to my spot on campus, idk why but like, I just really enjoy it now, I really hope it stays how I want it to stay (I'm not gonna overanalyze this sentence)..I'm probably gonna spend the night scrolling through shorts of YouTube, one last hurrah I guess. Also gonna contact ACSO tomorrow

    Entry: Watching Bojack horseman, and dang , it has some great characters. Also watched this movie called Babylon, pretty good movie all things considered. Also dermarolled, but like, at the start of the day, and then sweated a lot, let's hope my skin is nice to me 🥹...Saw, dang it i don't remember his name but he moved to Adrian but said he's done with, HIS NAME IS TRAYVIN, and I'm so glad I remembered the college he wanted to go to, but yeah we saw each other randomly in the gym, and he came at like, a time where I was feeling, I don't know, especially introverted, sometimes it's hard to put my full thoughts here but if I can't, then what's the point...Essentially my brother was talking with a lotta the people at the gym and even though it didn't affect me much, it started making me feel like I was too (opposite of outgoing), like, I think it even actively makes me avoid talking to people? Just to like prove I don't need to in a sense. Then he showed up and we had a small chat and it felt like perfect timing, but I still wasn't and am still not really sure how I truly feel, cause like, I'm mostly fine with my friend circle, kinda, I havent been happy with Andre or Ethan for a while now, nothing big or mind shattering, but lately I've been feeling more and more ignored by them and it even made me silence the duck just so I feel like I'm not dependent on them and would only check in whenever I wanted or felt the need or desire to, and not because there's a notification that I have to respond to immediately, but like, again I know this doesn't sound entirely logical ;-; but like I'd send memes or like, the historical ..Udm stuff and get like no reaction, and idk how I'm supposed to react to it, whether to just keep piling messages or receive the memo that I shouldnt be as active? Shouldn't talk as much, which is also something I'd do, like I'd see a notification but just ignore it, well I do that a lot anyways, but usually it's cause of external factors, now it'd just be internally, as a means of spite or revenge, or honestly a combination of the two, like, if you don't want to acknowledge my messages, then I won't acknowledge yours, but like, that's not really how our relationship is, and we have conversations, normal 2 or 3 sided conversations all the time and I know I don't have the right to a response all the time and should still be able to understand and respect boundaries and notice when my messages aren't landing? Or whether it's for a different audience, but just the piling up of it all kinda deflated me and just made me not want to engage ..I reenabled the notifications and I honestly don't know what I'm walking out of this thinking, like is there a lesson to be learned here..And this is a slightly unrelated topic but I'm finding it so unsettlingly Easy to hold gruges, especially against my mum and just like, let that anger, or annoyance, or a combination fester? And there's almost never a cathartic point where like, we just face it and hug it out (LOlll), it just pivots back to normal conversation and like the wound isn't healed, it's like a scab that would keep growing more and more and it's easy to ignore but whenever you have to face it, you' can tell how big it has become compared to all the other times in the past, and I'm at the point now where like, my heart is just heavy from grudge holding all day, usually over something insignificant but to my brain mechanism systems, it's a big deal or it's contributing to a much bigger scab that's only gonna get bigger!..And sometimes I feel like I don't want the answer to my problem, like now I'm thinking, well, why not just give her a new slate, peel off the scab and start again, but I know, I KNOW that immediately the idea came up in my head I pushed it down, and had to go against that voice or thing, just to write it here, like, it doesn't want to fix this, the grudge holding feels "good" and justified to it, and part of me wants to change to be better and stuff, and the other part of me just wants to keep accumulating "justification points", I feel justified not responding because they didn't respond, I feel justified ignoring her calls because they're almost always unnecessary,..I feel justified because he hurt me just as much as I hurt him. Things like that, and I have to start letting them go sooner or later, and now having to fight with myself to make the clearly obvious and self explanatory point is something I wasnt planning on, like, geez, forgive and forget much? Safety in feeling justified or unjustly wronged, a new aspect of my character discovered..Going to sleep now, got a lot to think about

    Entry: In the Spirit of going to sleep early I almost forgot to write here ;-;, didn't go to church today for reasons unknown, it gave me time to try to clear out my 90gb Google drive cause my subscription is running out 😭, plus do some other minor stuff, ..Feeling quite tired and the weather is quite cold and I still have some things I haven't fully processed through but I'll give them time to foster, or process in my head...also went driving practice with my dad and it wasn't bad at all, even parked with his help at least..Oh also told my mum about the driving place call, and responded to both Dr Hill, mina and Nafea, and Karen still hasn't responded!

We played uno and a game called Taco cat pizza something something 😭😭, also bagels and cream cheese are divineeeee. I also presented on my presentation and our group won the activity, even went exploring on campus just a bit,..There is definitely a ton of history in that school and I guess I'm gonna miss it once I graduate

I didn't really do any coding today, just felt off again, like, I just took a break, not gonna try to sugarcoat it, but  I was able to get another model running at least partly, no meeting with Dr nafea this week I assume. I'll ask tomorrow ..Also meeting with Karen tomorrow IN PERSON. I feel my normal sense of time coming back but still, it has been two weeks already! Classes start back up in two weeks woo! Woo?! I dont even remember typing that lol, but I guess I've been thinking and I dont know if I'm ready for classes to start back up, well, I do miss TDR and working out consistently - speaking of which, was able to play beat saber and asgards wrath, which I'm enjoying more. ..Im gonna start heading to bed now, talked a ton with pise today

    Entry: Today was fascinating!! First we got the chairs moved yay, redid some of the simulation stuff for Dr Hill despite intense annoyance yay, even worked on machine learning and getting at least decently good performance on it, yay! ..Now for the part that truly made my day, I was updating my resume, which also, I updated my resume and portfolio website, yay! And somehow I stumbled across a 2016 slide rule PDF, which funnily enough had my mentor - Molly lairds - name on it, so I was looking through it and found some hilarious stuff ..Then somehow got down a rabbit hole of looking at UDM archives which had absolute gems and got me so interested in the culture, it's giving me the same vibes as someone 100 years in the future reading my diary entries, that's how I feel reading what was happening in the past by people who are definitely dead by now, it is wildddd and super interesting. The only thing that did slightly sour it was that it wasn't getting much response from Andre or Ethan, which like, I really enjoyed doing it despite them, but I'd have thought that' they'd enjoy it just as much, and maybe they did, I don't know, anyways..Watching a lot more Olympics stuff and again, I got like, this huge sense of admiration but also somehow like dystopian ness, we all watching some human perform feats and cheering for them like, for entertainment, for a second it felt like it just collapsed on me and it all felt like, animalistic, but very human, like watching someone bounce around for our entertainment knowing fully well that we cant do what they do. I know that's not what the Olympics or sports in general is truly meant to evoke and it's much deeper, but in that instant it felt so absurd!..Anyways tho, ALSO tried a massage chair and I thought it would be vibrating but noooo, I honestly felt like I was in a bob burgers episode, experiencing the chair as it's like, finger like thingys were massaging my.body it was so weird!!! Even when it got to my butt which was so funny but felt so nice 😂, the whole thing felt really nice. Ope forgot to do my Duolingo, also my whistling has gotten so much better, especially the high pitched portion!..I also really have to do something with my hair!! I'm planning on sucking it up and following Eyitoonis routine..I also dreamt of our house in Nigeria which I forgot like immediately after waking up, which sucked cause remembering it, it was a fairly really nice dream! Like it feel nice, the memory of it, rose tinted glasses ofc, but I had randomly remembered it when we were driving home. Also finally gonna start the driving school thing!..Also! Andy messaged me

    Entry: We derma rolled boyssss  I'm kinda worried I'm like, gonna get an infection if I don't clean it properly 🥲🥲 so I literally just did my moustache, mostly cause yeah worried about cleaning it well ..Also we got the couch! But it doesn't fit 😭😭, so we are just gonna leave it outside and hope no one steals it xD  also aunty Pat brought mango and I haven't tasted the mango fruit in sooo long, it's so good. Cut it up and made it into a banana apple mango smoothie which was delishhhh ..Watched more monsters, recommended go go go loser rangers to pise, didn't go to school but did go to workout, but felt super weak, can't be too hard on myself cause I haven't worked out in a while ;-;. Honestly haven't thought much about my future still, but despite that, worked on ML stuff trying to reimplements sarwars stuff and honestly got good results, gonna, try to divide the work better tomorrow, still trying to reset the VM for Dr hill.

    Entry: Shopping was mostly a success!! Gotta get it in my head that I'm a XL now 🥹, I got a shirt that's pretty fire, but size small ;-;, also got white tshirts but large so they're kinda very snug, but wearing them with a belt and the jeans I got is a vibeee. I also bought sleeveless on a whim and I don't hate them, I haven't worn one in a longgg time, but I think I'm at a point where I'm now able to enjoy them ..Now it's 12 and everyone's still up and crap I forgot to tell my mum about the driving place. I'll do it tomorrow. Honestly did very little work today, went from church to making pizza to Forman mills to call to then chilling plus dinner and now I'm exhausted so voy a dormirrr. ..Also I've noticed Spanish being more like, second nature to come out especially for reactions and I think surrounding myself with a mix of both Spanish and English content is the reason, peroo. I gotta do the same with italian. Anyways voy a dormir. I've also been brushing more!

    Entry: Today was better, I'm still very indecisive but I had a conversation with Ali that kinda made me start rethinking how I was seeing things. Like he was talking about how he was struggling to find professors and phd programs that would take.him, specifically abroad, and then he mentioned how he would've given up if.not for the server which even though he's not super active, it's very heart warming to see, I really.hope he's.able to come here and study and experience everything really..On my end, I started wondering even more whether I wanted to be part of the publish of perish movement. And I'm like, even moreso distraught? Like, seeing someone like oriekaose who's able to mobilize people towards a goal, which is an amazing skill, And even I as I am, have some skills to be able to start making things that people might use. It's weird being in a spot where I can bring ideas to life, but lately.ive been feeling such little drive to do anything. It changed a bit when working with Sarwar, we got on a call and I wanted to implement the data in the paper and we made some good progress, even made progress on running the clinical data, but really only that section, and I got an accuracy of 75.percent which honestly isn't terrible. But yeah I could feel my brain.working and like trying to connect pieces, which I think is much nicer than how it was operating before and how I would just like, have to keep stressing over whether the code would work and trying to build on others code. I even designed my portfolio blog esque page to see if I could shake something in my head and something did shake, but not very much. ..It's like I'm missing something, like the dang chickpea recipe. It could've been good but something important, very important was missing and it caused it to be a big flop, just like now ,I'm missing something, I don't know if it's working with other people? A structure, a schedule? A project that I'm truly excited about?? I pretty much have the time, and pretty much need no money to do whatever it is that I'd need to do. I just don't know where to go from here. Also 5 more days till in person meeting with Karen, dare I say I'm looking forward to it...Wow its late, but I wanna pee, and brush my teeth, I've been brushing my teeth a lot more so good job me - just looked up whitening strips loll. ..We also went sofa shopping today and it was nice to get out, I've also been watching this YouTuber called dreamau who speaks Spanish and is quite entertaining ..Ugh I gotta make a decision

    Entry: Well to start, thank God for today, (I don't wanna say but), so, despite that...today was kinda a bust, well, I was kindaa bust today, my main goal for today, not really main goal but honestly giving all I did today, it was essentially the main goal, was to think about what I wanted to do in the future, and sheesh, I feel like there's this block in my brain stopping me from thinking about it or processing it as im thinking about it, and I'm not really sure about much of anything anymore ..Plus scrolling on Instagram and LinkedIn didn't help AT ALL, I saw Tunas account and the pictures she took of birds were stunning, and, ugh. To unblock I'm just gonna start writing, my first clear option is web development, like, obviously for obvious reasons ..But then I think about spending my entire life making websites, having to keep learning new technologies and facing new challenges, which I know I should enjoy? But at this point I really am not enthralled or captivated by the idea of having to learn another c++ or Js framework with all its unnecessary complexities, only to say "I make websites for a living" and would I even enjoy doing something like that, I mean, I won't, not enjoy it. Like if Solvaris did pull through and I was working on nation wide software, id honestly be pretty jazzed about it, but then again there's also the chance/possibility of being another cog in the wheel, or trying to survive off of low level freelance work. In the up side, God has been good, especially when it comes to finding new opportunities, like it feels like there's a constantly moving stream of open and opening doors which I'm grateful for, but who knows how long it would last for ..Ugh the dang inside out song is stuck in my head its so flipping good. Anyways, I can at least come to the conclusion that web design is always an option, like a, safe? Option a simple option. There are even so much more things to think about now like relationships????! I'm forgetting that I'm 18!!! Well, soon 19, THEN I'LL BE 20, God willing. Fffffffff...And now that the research door has presented itself, idk if I wanna do a PhD cause Dr, FREAK, I gotta do my general application, just set a reminder, anyways, yeah what the heck am I planning on doing, especially since there's still the slight weight, as maybe narcissistic as this sounds, people keep saying they see potential in me, that I tbh often dont see in myself and wonder why they spens their time on me, but that's just if I wallow in self, something, self wallow? Idek what I'm saying but like, with these choices, I'm 1, worried about making the wrong choice, 2, worried about setting up myself for even wronger choices, like..A few days ago I was imagining that if I truly wanted to go all in on volunteering, I would've seen what's up with the Cass community center nearby and gotten involved and my life's trajectory would've been soooooo different, like a dialogue path I didn't go down on and now it's locked out forever..And even just a sidenote, I made this chickpea thing which took more effort than usual in a meal and it honestly wasn't that great, threw it out - started watching an anime called monsters and it's pretty good, but like, idk if I tried to draw a comparison, it's like, putting in all this effort on something, using a lot of resources, only to start seeing signs that it's not turning out as you like, and then reaching the point where you have what you have, and either you suck it up or eat it and live with it. ..Ik Ethan is going through sth similar with deciding what to do for the rest of his lifeee and maybe I'll talk to him about it. Speaking of which my mind had drifted to Ben and remembering when he brought me oranges when I was going for fall getaway and it made me remember that like, there's more to our relationship if that makes sense, like lately I've been fine with letting everything end cause it'd be better for the both of us, but now idk if that's the truth ..I'm gonna head to bed now to catch up on sleep cause I messed up and slept too late yesterday and like, I still don't know what I want to do, at least I have options and that's a start?and I guess none of the options are wholly final? I can always go back? In theory

And dad had another job so it was like everything I wanted in a Sunday morning, but I kinda wasted it for a while, but then me and Eyitooni started watching this anime called go go loser rangers or sth like that and it was really entertaining, and a pretty good anime. Also watched a bit of undead and unluck, which, I don't really like the characters so not gonna continue it probably ..Mofe came back from his trip today, and my.mum made chin chin,which I still have a bunch of, honestly thinking about making my own spring roll ? I'm sure I can even make my own seasoning! And there's no meat in it, I think? Yeah, none, so I should be fine ..Oh! I'm getting a derma roller and I'm pretty excited about using it and seeing results! Especially in the beard department..Alegs just texted about the Venezuelan election and people getting freaking shot, I hope he's alright..Crap I'm so freaking privileged, I can't even, well I don't even want to curse in this situation, Alegs parents just had a falling out and now his area is in danger because of the election results, like fuckkkkk, that sucks! That's crappy, terrible trash, like, why are people like this, I can start trying to spew some crap about everyone living in peace, but crap humanity sucks

Like what the heck, me and Dan started playing league of legends - really fun game tbh, and like, 5 hours went by? And it felt like just an hour at best, till the last few, it was something else, I didn't even feel the same level of boredom or fedup Ness as when playing payday. Lol is an interesting game, really keeps the attention, but wow Saturday flew by, just straight right before my eye, and soon enough it'll be Monday! ..It's truly wild, also ended the day with baldurs gate, attacked dammon for his items and felt slightly bad after 😭, more like felt bad that I should.be feeling bad, idk... you know what I'm feeling. Apart from that tho today truly flew by, didn't do much work, I did work a bit on dr Hill stuff but it did annoy me a good amount so I can't say it was all entirely progressful work, but work is work! Tomorrow, we'll see how much more productive I can be. My mum's making chin chin tomorrow woo! Gonna head to bed now, woke up at 8 today which is pretty late for my standards

It should not be retried.That’s all we know. hen again I don't think I ever will be so either I do it or I dont do it ..This part of summer is the accelerated arc, it's like, being able to stay at home is soooo nice, watching somny boy on the television, or physical 100 while home alone, that whole shebang is great, but I also think it has made me more lackluster with work, and I don't know whether I should blame myself or the sudden difficulty of the tasks I'm approaching, which, piggybacking off that, I am glad to have learned a lot about AI, and I did wish that Dr nafea would've stayed on campus so we could keep our chats, but I'm slightly looking forward to working more with him on senior design. I really don't know if it's the path I want to go on. I don't know if web dev is what I want, I don't think it's what I want, would I even make it to that point where I get to make the choice?..I have no idea, and I think Ethan's in a similar both with me so I should talk to him more about this. ..This, wow, I've been writing for like 30 mins, my.thumbs are quite sore. My big summary is that this summer has been filled with low lows and medium highs. It has also brought some new experiences, but not a ton, I've learned a bunch of new stuff, and eight here and right now, there's a lot of paths that my life can go ..This senior year is going to bring things that I'll need to push through. I'm hoping that, right now I can overcome myself and with the help of God, push through all of those. God willing, I'll be writing here about my college graduation and reminiscing, and I hope it's a voice note, future me make it a voice note. Look at me writing a whole essay lol

    Entry: Lol rn my dad is trashing on the cyber truck, but today was a very strange day, a very very strange day...Woke up, and since brother is in Chicago, got the house to myself, my dad gave Eyitooni his spring rolls and it hit me harder than it should've, or maybe I just decided to be offended but it soured the start of the day, so I tried getting some work done, did a bit on reimbursement but not just, just enough to help ethan, then watched, solar opposites, the bear - great show - and bobs burgers at varying times, AND EVEN SONNY BOY, and it reminded me of how much I loved the anime. Didnt work out, tried to play beat saber but the right controller kept disconnecting so played asgards wrath. Worked on dr Hills work and found the source of the original problem but like the simulation can be shaky so I'm not sure, gonna do more tests tomorrow. Didn't even do anything for dr nafea today, ..Side note, made fries, and giles and Yoda from a long time ago texted on the group chat, and like, they were reminiscing about me throwing a grenade in COD, I don't remember playing COD with them, or much of anything apart from my ravings about Betty la fea, some drama and making the simping channel, I was looking back at pictures earlier and still yeesh, there is a lot that I've forgotten to the point that I don't even know if it actually happened, and I suppose that's also a big part of why I journal, I fear forgetting important, or even mundane moments, or random things like using the deep fryer to make fried today or deciding on getting curly hair for the long run, there's still so much somewhere here I'm that would've been lost .To time so I'm grateful for that..I also helped my younger brother weasel out of playing the piano for the church  😂 and I get to do laundry this week with no laundry for the next two weeks woo!! I'm happy about that ..I've also been biting my nails a lot more, especially when coding,  which I gotta unlearn

    Entry: I'm hungryyyy and might just go get a slice of cheese 😭. Update, got me some cheese, well just one and I'm still hungry, just a lil less so, and if I don't think about it it's essentially gone. Mofe has gone for his Chicago thing and I hope.ill be able to get the house to myself, I need some alone time, I'd love some alone time, that one summer was really nice in that sense, but I'm also enjoying this summer ..A bad highlight was my meeting with Dr Hill, he looked quite disappointed in the work and I have to say that I don't blame him, even following that, we had the meeting with Dr nafea and I'm sure hes also disappointed to a point, I'm still trying to pick up RNNs but it's moving slowly, even tried touching reimbursement today to help ethan but very little progress was made and I can now feel his frustration,I played a baldies gate for a long time cause I did feel dejected and demotivated, but at this point I cant stop, I've already had big wins and just need to keep pushing forward!..Tomorrow I'll start with reimbursement to do something new, then transition to Matlab, then Dr nafea with wahala sprinkled around, ..Talked a good amount with Alegs tonight and he was talking about how his parents had a fight and he was feeling bad, and I can relate to him, and it sucks and I so feel bad for him. We chatted and I hope it helped calm him a bit. I lost my elevate streak :(, I could get it back but don't feel like it. Feeling tired so gonna head to bed..I gotta remind my mum to send the graduation speech

    Entry: Chill day, got overwhelmed about trying to watch the videos for Dr Nafea while trying to tidy things up for Dr Hill, I am having some issues with connecting it to Matlab and I'm also questioning the logistics.of some things and realizing that there's still a lot I don't know which sucks, but I am learning everyday! Piece by piece ..I wanna grow my hair so I'm trying to make it a habit to wear the bonnet, I wanna do something more with it tho , maybe apply another texturizer? - quickly decided against this, but we'll see, maybe an afro is good enough :*)..Ugh gotta head to campus tomorrow, might see if my dad's going to work, he probably isn't so I should be able to follow him and then come back when he picks Eyitooni but we'll see. ..Talked to Benjamin de pater, who also participated in the ncae games and is a friend of Ethan's, he's fun to talk to, likes books, we chatted for a good while, it was nice, anyways gotta head to bed, trying to reclaim sleep!

    Entry: I am still truly very happy that the robot is movingn! So happy, especially since I was already planning a meeting with Dr Hill, and it was by pure chance or just thank God that I spotted the green line when the robot was moving properly, but it wasn't happening Everytime so something was happening, then. I decided to try doing it when it was facing the lidar and it worked! Which was a more than pleasant surprise, worked as in, the green line for the local plan was showing till it then diverged, then I realized the robot was turning in opposite directions, tested it with teleop twist and realized that was the case, fixed it in the xacro file which I remember having spotted sth like that, then Bam the robot was movingg. In hindsight it was mainly namespacing and params but it was still quite very difficult ..Did some later learning on neural networks but got quite overwhelmed but mainly just realizing how much Im not understanding so decided to take a step back for the day and tackle it harder tomorrow. We keep moving! Learned more about resnets tho which was nice

Which was amazing, broke down the bookshelf to prep for the new one and just took a break from work and thinking about workz and I'm not going to bring it here to this journal...Watched blue exorcist and made more spring roll dough, even getting better at it. Finished day with chill working on Figma, which feels more like creative work than any form of chore. Really enjoyed today! Even found some old things that brought back memory, like a schedule from 2018 when we first started at central and had professors like mr Fleming. EVEN found out Mr Dixon, Keith Dixon music teacher, got arrested for firing a gun at an apartment!  Wilddd, anyways, goodnight, I hear crickets and it's cold and not that dark cause of the light opposite us, but it acts like moon light so I don't mind

God willing tomorrow I figure out whats wrong with the local planner and everything works, I'd be so happy, but I'll also be working on learning more about CNNs cause I'm watching the videos and thinking to myself that I don't remember any of what I'm learning 😭, specifically about bias being added to the feature map - output of CNN and the CNN just being like the weights to the image that get dot producted which makes sense now but still dang ..Also my brothers doing the journi program and having to come up with an idea and I gave him a cultural app idea lol..Even played some sky today!..Edit .OOP forgot to send this for yesterday

    Entry: 1159 ENTRY WOO WE MAKING PROGRESSSSS,..On Dr Hill stuff, I'm elated!!!!!!! It was the issue with the static layer and I had to look up the dos documentation for the different parameters and try changing and adding some and it was the final map topic paramtwr that got the global cost map to show WOO, but the local cost map still isn't showing, BUT ALSO the robot moved!!!! It just spun in a circle weirdly but flipping still!!!! We making progressss. Now I'm getting errors about interpolation and dropped frames that I'm sure I can look up and hopefully not spend another week on. Plus we get 1 week of grace for Dr nafea to freshen up on our machine learning knowledge which is amazing and takes off so much stressnsince I just focused on the dr Hill work and il so glad I did cause the heat plus I was hungry and just felt do drained but just kept pushing and we got a breakthrough woo! Tomorrow I'll look more at the documentation and make sure all the params make sense, and then blah blah HECK YEAH. ..I know it's not perfect, and FUNNILY ENOUGH, I had to reinstall everything because the dang virtual box broke down! And now I have qemu and it's kinda so much better! It also almost broke but was able to fix it thank God!! I'm so glad progress is being made, the dopamine hit was niceee, gotta go to bed, I said no more staying up late 😭😭...I was even thinking of pulling an all nighter but I'm already tired and don't wanna ruin the progress, that cost map looked so beautiful 😭😂 so freaking satisfying! Ok gonna brush m teeth and go to bed, also tried making spring roll dough !!..WOO!there was also a big thunderstorm last night

Gotta talk to Dr hill too..Made a lemon shaving thing, it's nice, very high in sugar tho which sucks...talked to Ethan about baptism and why he was feeling overwhelmed. I kinda also don't know where I'm gonna be going after college, or even if I'll make it to Christmas. Nope we don't think about that, we keep, moving, hoping Karen isn't expecting anything, not feeling any real desire to reach out ..No more sleeping at 12!

Tomorrow I'll work on getting the data done for the second paper, but first I'll ask him about merging classes...Okay what else stomach ache, what's with the flipping stomach aches!!!! Am I suddenly lactose intolerant 😭, made the pizza today and it was nice, but yeah, I wish I took pics in the church...Tomorrow we'll see how Dr Hill stuff goes, maybe I'll ask Michael to work with me on it as well and see how far we can get cause chat gpt is being useless and I really wanna give Dr Hill something this week, we have like 2 weeks left and it's already somehow the weekday again, and soon it'll be Friday, and then maybe Christmas, then I'll have made it to Christmas, that's still my goal and I still haven't forgotten the stresses and worries..I'll cut out dairy products from my diet and see how I feel, daulio another weight app is perfect for this!

    Entry: Apparently Trump got shot!!! And I didn't know if not for some random YouTube news, its kinda wild, like, really wild, if that thing did connect, I'd be writing a whole different kind of story, it's wilddddd...Anyways, was pretty productive in the sense that, was able to get a good amount of work done, I mean, duh, but like, I think I've made good progress on the dr Hill stuff, less good progress on dr nafea stuff but progress nonetheless? Gonna start trying to implement another baseline and it's so much more hassle than I thought huGh. ..Hmm what else what else, parents went to a party, my elbow hurts, like in one specific spot and I'm sure it's because of how I bench press, that or the hammer raises, I think it was the hammer curls cause that's when I stopped and lowered the weight cause my elbow was feeling uncomfortable, good thing it's not worse tho..One good thing I'm taking away from Dr Hill work, and even Dr nafea is that things take time and it's really forcing me to be patient, I , crap I think my next project should be that hub for all my brain thoughts but then working on the wahala app makes me feel like I'm wasting my brains, idk , I can do what I want! ..And I want a brain hub, and also no contact for legal measure yet, which again, truly very concerning. Site is still functional thank God. ..Gonna head to bed cause speaking of God, we going to churchh. Hasta la visa chico..Also just reached act 3 in bg3 woo!

    Entry: The twelve is such a good show!! Played too much baldurs gate 😭😭..ALSO GOT My driver's license thing done and was 20 mins late to Dr nafea meeting because of it. Also slept on my arm and woke up with little feeling in my arm for a few seconds and it was wild and scary and must be what people who loose feeling in their body feel like 😭😭, I was already slightly panicking. **′..Even same with the d9rivers license stuff, we were lucky a woman named destinee? Or desinee? Was there, she has Mrs Muhammed -Joy- vibes and she literally saved the day God bless her, hmm did som.work on Figma and Dr nafea stuff but that's about it, can't believe it's another weekend, feels like my perception of time is speeding up and I can't tell if I lik it or not. ..Honestly another highlight of the day was talking to aleggs, I really enjoyed our conversation and we talked about college and I ranted to him about ben, not a lot but enough to get it to someone and it was nice to just do it. THEN I talked to someone about help with Ros, like randomly messaged them and we ended up having a great conversation about research! And we were talking about the flawed aspects of research etc etc, it was.also a great mentally stimulating conversation, gonna go sleep now, bonne nuit..Also Dr Hill invited me to a Detroit bus tour!.We are on track to make it to Christmas, let's keep moving shall we

That's right, baldies gatess, just finished my fight with ketheric and of course.jaheira died loll, doesn't matter 😭, so close to levelling up. ..Hmm, my knee randomly crapped out in the middle of the night and this makes the third time, which has me pretty worried, especially since I can feel it popping when I stretch, speaking of stretching, worked on jump ropes and I think I've gotten better!! At full performance I feel pretty light. Anyways gonna sleep in parents bed today, we'll see how it goes, it'.is quite late, the view from their bed is nice, no stars out today tho. ..Felt really productive today to be honest, like, spent a good few hours on Dr Hill work, and I think I made progress in the sense that I can now create a map, which honestly all things considered its.pretty good progress, and only bevause I searched the GitHub of a random dude on a random forum and it made me realize some name spacing.issues which I'm glad are fixed? Anyways still much to be done, which I'm even planning on making better once the summer is over, which is in like, A MONTH! ..Hmm, what else, yeah one thing to note, getting a good start to the day matters , compared to says of scrolling on reddit for 3 hours in the morning, I just got on my laptop and started working, and making headway. Tomorrow I need to focus on Dr nafea stuff cause, sheesh, I wanna say I've been slacking but I haven't even really 😭, anyways talk to you tomorrow, still have the slight cough

Which was nicee, made lentils and ate them while watching blue exorcist, which was also nice, spent like, a good, 6 ish plus hours trying to get ros2 navigation to work but to no avail, we try again tomorrow, even though I'm getting discouraged, I'll be meeting with Mike tomorrow so it should be fine, wow its already Thursday, gotta zoom on the research!! ..I'll tell Dr hill that we can meet right now, tomorrow I'll start with just mapping one robot and at least that will give me a sense of all that I need and what is happening, then somehow I'll try to apply it to two robots 😭..Then for Dr nafea work, started compiling the papers to try to understand them better, didn't get far but def gonna pick it up tomorrow, especially since I'm already converting the pics to the GAF format, honestly I should also read the paper, and continue general ML learning, I've said it once and I gotta say it again, I'm slacking 🥹, I wrked on the Figma for the wahala app tho and even gave ideas in the WhatsApp, I think it's an app that could go somewhere! And I am appreciative that just by being known as being good at UI stuff, I get a foot in the door of pretty interesting projects, which, yay!...Hmm what else, I've been chatting with Josephene more, I got her to watch flcl and bubble! We gotta talk about more things than anime tho , didn't workout, again, my brother didn't go to campus, well, he did, but like, late, so it wouldve been a 20 minute workout, so I just decided to play beat saber, which I did! Also I just heard the hxh song out of nowhere. ..My stomach has really been on something else this last week, idk what new thing I added to my diet? Maybe its just tired of everything 😭..Oh! I also had terrible sneezes and still have a cough which sucks, and at one point my nose was just full on blocked, but then it got better and now I hardly notice or sneeze, I think it's cause of the fan, tomorrow we gotta start the day right, I'm not gonna get to just watch TV and code :(, since everyone's essentially home, buttt I do get to, stay up late? And just watch on my computer - I've been watching Andor and it's aight, just aight ..Played many hours of bg3 tonight, like made orthon kill himself, then did the trials of gauntlet, then fought Balthazar and won fairly quickly! I can't think of anything else to talk about, my dreams have been pretty mundane lately, and I realize that we have like, what, 3 ish weeks till jobs over and maybe a month and change before school starts back up, it wasn't a very sunny side up summer, started out very rocky , honestly the middle was quite chill, which I'm like still in, or at least wrapping up, I'm really glad LM isn't going that far, as Karen hasn't contacted me and I'm just gonna say I got very busy as a cover so we just stall till classes start, I still haven't got paid, it's not something I wanna think about, but I'll ask Dr mina in the spirit Of changing m.Mindsets, which is something that Ive honestly forgotten I was trying to do :*), oh well, also finished psalms!!!!!!!!! Woohoo, gotta do elevate, might read past entries .

I don't think it was burn out cause everytime someone mentions it that's when I start getting worried, but I found out that we have 2.5 weeks left, no paper for Dr Hill, little progress with Dr Naf, im not feeling accomplished at all..I just saw the Figma pic in my gallery and knew I didn't take a pic so the next assumption was WhatsApp, which it was loll, just turned on notifications on it so I dont miss anything, but yeah I started working on the UI or working more and got some good progress in, moreso than any other work,.also cause I spent like 2 hrs plus on baldurs gate, which don't get me wrong I'm having fun, my characters are really well made..I had a bad stomach ache halfway through eating and I think it's because my stomach is rejecting thegreasy food I've been eating :*), but we are gonna change that with some lentils tomorrow. ..Also, no workout today cause apparently FC is closed ;-;and no meeting with Mike, tomorrow no more slacking, I got too happy with the home alone work environment that I think I got thrown in for a loop today, pretty chill day in general tho, finished acolyte and still enjoying it, maybe more than the boys even ..Also I think I sit leaning on my right hip? Cause it hurts even though I was technically sitting on both sides, Anyways tho, it's late, ciao

    My mood Happy
    
    Entry: Ok so highs and lows, today started off honestly swimmingly, at first I wasn't feeling it but the more I vibed the more I thoroughly enjoyed it, I was home, older brother went to work and younger brother started his already, then from there it was just me at home, with the television so I put on some Netflix and started watching something called imperfects or sth, then physical 100, as I coded the Dr Hill stuff, which also went well but I'm boutra get into the navigation part again so wishhh me luckkk. ..Moving on from that, started watching don't look up which is great so far..Going on from there was to campus, where I, thank God I remembered, reset my password by using inspect element, which, it WAS 123456, LIKE WHAT, I know I tried that 😭, multiple times...Anyways tho, it works now so yay. Went to the baseball game and it was fun, talked with a bincha the students and retalked with the seed students, who once again commented about my muscles. ..Moving on tho, there was this seed student who ran track, also in Belle isle!! And maybe even around the time I did, as well as she knows Richard and journi, so that was fun. I didn't eat anything there and wasn't really tempted to, part of me is debating whether to include this but I will since this is my journal!!! And I get to make choices, but I also don't want to place more importance on it than I should. So originally I thought Ben won't come and honestly forgot about him, till he did come and he was pretty late and I was wondering why he was.late, and it was quite awkward cause I feel like I actively ignored him?  Or at least didn't go out of my way to interact like I would for maybe andre or Val or something, and then again I started to feel like I was doing things like cheering cause he was there, but I know we already moved past that part of my psyche and I have to continue reminding myself of that. ..Then we got to the bus, oh, also we won! But yeah we got to the bus and I was talking with Hannah, and even before the game started and she's honestly pretty/really fun to talk to, we somehow started talking about languages and shes conversant in French, then we were talking about Europe etc etc all through the bus ride and it was nice, we were the only ones talking so it was slightly awkward, but I still really enjoyed the conversation, she has been to France, Switzerland, Germany I think, Moscow, Italy, which is wild, but yeah I thought I left my headphones or they dropped at the stadium but THANK GOD I was able to find it in the lab, just..Sitting there waiting for lil ol me. But now I'm just gonna like, brain rot and fall asleep, or honestly fall asleep early cause I've been slacking on that, I had a bad stomach ache earlier but I'm currently getting rid of it xD, just needed a banana ..Im also considering taking more.pictures, I know I'm writing here as like a history book but pictures are also great, somehow it was Aranza motivted cause she has a camera, and i have a camera! Which I've neglected, and a kindle too, I should stop neglecting both of those. ..Also I'm so close to finishing psalms, which yayyyy. Tomorrow, we continue work on Dr Hill and Dr nafea, no reimbursement for the rest of the week honestly, it's taking too much of my focus since it's direct and straightforward, I need to ponme las pilas chico!! Crap I just realized I didn't even get the chance to workout, well, I walked a lot if that counts, 9k steps yeah boy, also something may be wrong with my left knee, we will see if I have any of those moments where it just gives out..Not resisting sucked, especially because I was nauseous, which I'm still not fully sure why, and I have a semi sore throat ..Also had a dream about the game, it's like my dreams have been mirroring reality lately

It was nice, played with the dog, watched lord of the ring and it was pretty interesting, there were a bunch a other people there too and got in a convo with Dans brother - the pastor, but dang I forgot that it was him and asked him if he coded, which I already knew the answer to 😭😭, but he started talking eschatology and the end of times and like, I checked out, but again it got me to realize I still know little about the Bible ;-;;, dang didn't even read Psalms today smh my head. ..I also have a sore throat which sucksss, played bg3 today tho and love the combo of characters I have, brought shadowheart back in and shes slayingg with the healing lol..Redownload Reddit but gonna delete it pretty soon ;-;, also watched some of the boys, and worked a bit on reimbursement. Oriekaose has an app idea that I think actually has some merit and he wants me to design it so I gotta make it look good ..I'm also failing on my summer goals of car ownership ;-;, and it sucks, dang it! Also what else hmm, dang it's getting late, Josephene started playing sky, and I'm now waiting more and more for two embers

Then made chocolate chip cookies off the chips in a chocolate bar and it honestly turned out amazing! Well, turned out really great, even the cookie dough felt great loll. Didn't do much work but we were able to unzip the mimic folder woo! And had our meeting with Dr nafea which so turned out good, I gotta design, worked a bit too on reimbursement project and got rid of some bugs ..Hmm learning French more, don't know how much of it will stick, even woke up pretty early, my mum lost her voice which is so weird

    Entry: Nice independence day, made lentillls and it was honestly really really good, didn't even go bonkers on the seasoning, added more tomato stuff than water, also, both parents working same with half of tomorrow so home alone! ..ALSO, Sarwar and I may have finally found a way to unzip the folder which, aYayyy, I was compiling all my findings , watched a movie called project.power, argued with Andre about project 2025, watched American dad on tv after making s conscious decision to take a step back from work, played beat saber, and somehow I'm at baseline again! But like, happy, chill..We EVEN GOT DONUTSS, for independence day at least, idk if I mentioned but I'm learning French. ..Dang I was gonna say sth but forgot, wait yeah, also played asgards wrath 2!! And there was a conversation I've been meaning to have, which is, since when I started letting my physique define who I am, like it was something that hit me as I was prepping for the seed meeting, just like, imagining how they'd react to my body and just all around focusing on their physical perception of me, which I partly attribute to the seed gen 2 cause they do that.a lot to me ..And that's not to say that I don't like our but it's definitely not positively impacting my perception of myself, since now I also start seeing myself as muscles or physical attributes first, everything else later...Side note, something that had more of an effect on me than I thought it would is the idea that perception is reality, cause story time, I saw my brother putting together this tripod ish stand and then in my head, was like, ok that makes sense, he's gonna be recording his workouts and like my brain was already processing the implications and just like, analyzing it and stuff, but later my mum walks in like, look at my new wig stand thingy, and then it hit me that perception really is reality, and now it's helping me see that when I start thinking that x is doing y just to antagonize me, I remember that my perception is reality .But that doesn't mean it's real? Like, my perception lives all in my head, and it may not be real. ..Idk if that makes sense now, but it's also applying to my self image, like how I perceived others perceiving my body has turned that into a reality in the sense like, id be thinking they'd be thinking about my body, and that makes me think it happens, but reality is different. Wow its late and I don't wanna start sleeping later and later, ciao

    Entry: Okay okay so, last few weeks, confusing? Weird, finished link click, oh! My dad got his z fold 5, and AND it was ringing! Like, the alarm was going off and he was trying to keep it away from my mum till the case comes, AND she was in the kitchen so I had to rush to turn it off, but she entered as I was about to put it away which was scary like I was shaking, heart racing, but I managed to hide it well, turned the volume down, in hindsight should've turned it off!!! But yeah and now it's there, and I'm hoping it's not on vibrate or something😭😭..Coding, was , painful, worked mainly like 99 percent on the udm site, and didn't go to campus to workout cause brother just kinda snuck out 😭..Also July 4th tomarrrowww, so fireworks yay?

    Entry: Why am I still awake?,because of nostalgia and a dumb LinkedIn post. First, nostalgia because I was trying to look up people from mind builders and vicsum for no reason really, but it brought back a lotta memories, ofc rose tinted glasses and all that, I remember us having to wait outside cause we hadn't paid the school fees, weve come so far since then..I had my seed presentation as mentioned, and it was nice, I only prepped for 30 minutes but I had an hour 😂 so I just did a code along, I think my shorts were wet, but idk, so I'm not gonna dwell on it, at least it gives me something silly to beat myself.up over..That just reminded me of David ayensu, cause we made EA games, but my mind drifted to wearing a cap and idk I got side tracked, but yeah nostalgia woo, even almost forgot I had an emotion for that, even though it really should be an activity...Now feeling quite tired, shouldn't be awake this late, we'll chat more tomorrow

Unfortunately didn't get much done for reimbursement, it's s bummer, I've been torn between the three plus projects and it suckksksss. ..Had an amazing.workoit today tho, which is always nice, also saw Josephine on campus which was new , dang tomorrow I'll have to ask Dr nafea to postpone the meeting cause seed presentation which power point ready. Also idk how many times I've written it here but clouds are underrated, they're truly beautiful...Oh also watched supacell in the television today, gonna start heading to bed, oh! Finished HXh, also I've told both parents about the baseball game woo! That's about it from me, don't have a ton to say,..Thinking of starting to write my dreams again cause Ik I had a fun dream today but noope forgot it pretty quickly 🥲

    Entry: Ended the day poorly, but was a slightly productive Day, except issues with Ros that I wanna throw hands with..Today we fought some bedbugs and my mum got some diatomaceous earth or something, but we are def getting rid of them bugs...Hmm what else what else, can't wait to workout again, hmm, worked on ML and ecg stuff, found a new paper and now working on getting the dataset to match as closely as possible, so we'll see how that goesss. Hmmm,..Also checked seed chat and Valerie found a pic of me where I received the student of the year scholarship LOlll, and idk where! They said the competition was tough too, which is nice that I won ..Rewatched what happened to Monday, great movie, but also watches some more Simpsons which is always nice. Tomorrow we work more on ML and Ros, I didn't get the chance, or have the motivation to do reimbursement. It's quite nice not having to be on campus every day of the week from 8 to 6, Ik I semi got used to it last time, but this time the summer is zooming, and flip I have my presentation tomorrow!!..Random thought, I somehow learned to whistle super high pitched when watching Hunter x Hunter car ..Watched random shows on the television too, oh also had a call with sarwar, and played some baldurs gate

    Entry: I think I ended today good, good as in played baldurs gate and leveled up plus helped the gnomes in grymforge so I'm now on track to find the adamantine forge but gotta bring neres head back to the myconid people..Anyways, yeah I was serious earlier about changing my mindset, and I'm starting with not dwelling or ignoring, and not running away, dwelling would concern things I can't control, while ignoring or running away would be me being inactive on things I can control, this involves reaching out to Dr mina about the payment for legalmeasure, right now I'm feeling confident, thank God, like pumped and ready to tackle whatever, I hope to keep this attitude  ..Part of it involves being more assertive, with myself too..Just deleted reddit, why? WHY NOT, this is supposed to be the sunny side up summer, I can't spend my life cowering over things I have no control over, it's all fleeting!! Like the wind, bam ecclesiastices knowledge, might even read it

    Entry: My mindset needs to change, like, I' was just thinking about all my choices and how they've led me here, and it starts to feel like I've gone far in a playthrough but made bad choices and now can't go back. which is essentially life, but ik I can change, my brains still growing yay, but like, can I change how I approach stressful situations, how I handle unknowns, how I view myself, my habits? It's not impossible and I'll have to take things one step at a time, but idek how to do it, fake it till you make it? I'll need something concrete to change, idk if there are any good books about it, there are a good amount of things I would like to change, my fear of the unknown and stressful situations, my overthinking in terms of worrying about situations I have little information in, and the tendency to shut down, my envy, which honestly has gotten better, especially the more I find a path and continue focusing on myself and what I want, my continuous thought process that I'm the center of attention and people do things to me, and not because they're their own person, especially my brother, like when hes telling Dr mina about him doing AI, at that point I felt like it was a jab at me, and I didn't explore it at that point as it was my default reaction, but looking back at it now, it ..Almost essentially makes no sense as he would've mentioned it regardless of whether I was there or not  plus 5 other reasons why it makes no sense, imagining myself in a bubble has helped in outdoor situations, like at the gym, but there's still things for me to work on..

    Entry: So I'm staying home, not going to campus, I gotta text Mike, but yeah I got a call from the student employment office about the work stuff and let them know I wasn't authorized to work so I won't be getting paid, etc etc, he had said Dr mina reached out to him, dang it dr mina, she was cc'ed in the email tho, but I'm holding it together, no over worrying, no shutting down, we keep moving, deep breaths. Okay so the danger in this scenario - Im trying to take a step back and see whether my reaction matches the danger. But I'm not thinking of any danger, which is not to say that none exist, but it's also to say that I should only worry or stress over what I can control, and right now I've controlled what I can by letting them know I can't get paid. I won't know Dr minas response so I can't think or argue or stress over it, but essentially my conclusion right now is that my reaction isn't matching the danger and I should keep moving forward, always forward

Our goal is still to make it to chrismuh and June is almost over, then it'll be July, and I'm gonna stop there cause it's gonna start getting daunting, summer barely just started, but yeah..It's gonna be marvelous! Off to bed for me, worked on dr Hill, dr nafea, dr mina and designing chaos chess game today.

    Entry: Guess who didn't shut down! This guy, made the call, didn't overstress and was playing baldurs gate as I did, she said there's one more form for UDM to do, not me to do thank God, and I should check to make sure that it's completed so that the school gets paid, idk if I should ask Dr mina about it or just let it be, we'll see. I'm also not fancying going for phase 2, but inhale exhale, I'm stopping myself from spiraling into what ifs, I'm only going to tackle with the information I know, no speculations, as that has been the cause of a lot of pain, the not knowing, the wondering what x would say or what y would do or why y did x, so none of that, I'm only going to confront what I know

    Entry: Crap I was having a really productive day, was gonna say good day, I mean, every day is good, but today was weird, but very productive, went on two calls with Dr mina and the riipen group, she approved me for working with Dr nafea! And I finally emailed Karen, and she responded back about a chat this evening, and I said ofc I'm free, but then that kinda brought me back to earlier this summer and part of me feels part of me shutting down, like, I'm already feeling anxious as to what she's going to say, and like, I'm feeling how I normally feel before every meeting, very unsure of everything and just waiting for everything to collapse, partly regretting that I reached out but also knowing that I would beat myself up if I didn't. I'm also thinking of, not really a worst case scenario, but like, there's nothing that'll signify that this meeting would be bad for any reason? And I think I'm just carrying over left over, pain? From that time period. Honestly writing this calmed me down a lot and as I was writing, I was understanding that the reaction doesn't match the danger. There's nothing that indicates that I should be worried, and from her point of view, I'm sure she would like to quickly catch me up with a call. I can't say I'm 100 percent calm, but I'm much better than when I started this entry and at least I'm ready to tackle the call with enthusiasm, I'm definitely playing baldurs gate tonight, my brains kinda fried, or at least I need a good rest

I am going to email Karen and John tomorrow, no ifs or buts..I guess I am feeling better at grasping ros 2 more and more, piece by piece we getting better, I wish I had sth more substantial to say, now I'm overthinking stuff and have a headache, I'm off to bed

Looking to get back into reading bookks, don't know where to start tho..Also made candied almonds and they're good!

Def gonna have some things to say once it does get started. Either way tho, went to a celebration by Mr Tosin, and It was nice, food was chill, venue too, my TMJ is acting up and it's annoying, I also have to fix my truenas server UGHHH, ..I was quite productive tho, worked on the redesigned FOAPA page which looks easier to use now, and also worked on compiling papers and reading some of them for research, twas chill..Then played Bg3 and my characters are so flipping strong it's amazing, partly except gale, but he's useful in other ways! Like.knock, counter spell, oh snap I should use him to resurrect the minotaurs, that'd be cool. That's about it for today tho, worked on those two projects and nothing else, it is what it is, tomorrow, we keep grinding!..Also charged my Kindle! Hoping to use it more

    My mood Motivated
    
    Entry: Honestly today was a really nice stress free day, even played baldura gate, but I realized there's a big decision I haven't talked about, which is whether it would behoove me to do research with Dr nafea for senior design, orrrrr, go with Andre and Ethan and potentially someone else, right now I'm leaning towards going with Dr Nafea, especially since I'm kinda excited about my potential in the AI field, in truth I have been slacking when it comes to learning and implementing stuff, but I have gotten better at looking through papers and I even get excited to see what people find in their papers and how they approach problems ..Part of me is also worried that I only like this cause I have Dr nafea guiding me, which is something I may talk to him about to see what he has to say, but I was also rereading the fight with Ben about like, him using gpt 4 and realized that I really really wouldn't want to be in that situation and right now I'm still getting riled up, like literally in this moment, but like, I like the research I'm doing, even though I can feel myself getting competitive and like, striving to do much better or at least stand out? Over sarwar specifically, and idk how to like, stop it? Cause then if I don't keep pushing, I'll feel like I'm just falling behind on purpose, it's also something I've wanted to ask him, he's essentially a new mentor now loll. This weekend I'll complete that HR dataset thingy project I was doing, this week has been super hot but I guess my productivity hasn't taken a huge hit, I'm like 40ish episodes into HXH and I'm enjoying it , I worked on the mailing feature built in with an attached PDF and what do you know it worked!! That definitely surprised me xD, but I'm very happy with how it turned out, it's like two days of Ws on the reimbursement project, did some work on Dr Hill stuff, mainly learning and then planning how I'll approach our pioneer robot, I'll see if I can work more on it tomorrow then I'll just ask Dr hill ..It's so hot 😭😭, but yeah depending on what Dr mina had chosen with riipen, I may just go with Dr nafea, it'll be like I'm diverging, which honestly would be an interesting route to take! I don't hate it, idk how I see my future self handling it? I think theres a good chance I'll be fine? In the sense that it doesn't stop me from going my skills in other departments, it gets me familiar with a skill that could essentially future proof me and the learning potential is potentially much more than with a one off project with riipen or whatever I could come up with that I could just do as a side project. I'm like, 76 to 80 percent leaning towards him,but I would like to see how our current research will pan out, I just gt access to MIMIC and now I gotta sign up for big query to see how it works but it looks fairly interesting, especially if I can get experience with it early on, ..Part of me also feels like I'm doing all this for someone else ,you know who I'm tired of saying his name, but in reality, it might just be like what I've noticed before, with me attaching the result to the person after the fact, but all through my deliberations on it, he didn't come to mind, I also still gotta post on my channel!! Gotta work on the chess game loll, and make my own chess engine!! Which does sound pretty cool tbh, that's weekends me work, let's see how we do! Also I really gotta get a good hair bonnet, apart from all that tho, today was pretty chill, I watched mrwhosethebosses wedding speech video and it was honestly amazing, also had a weird dream about spiders that I'm sure future me wouldn't remember, hii ..Time for another good night sleep, gotta.prep for the seed presentation anddd gotta tell my parents about the tigers game

Thank God I converted the PDF to images, then uploaded it to image kit, and it worked swimmingly!!! ..It's also HAWTTTTTT, very hot 😭, fan plastered on me all day, my younger brother came back from the thingy with kapor center, crap I didn't do any dr nafea stuff, tomorrow I'll do it, less reimbursement stuff, but I gotta start tracking my hours for dr Hill!!! 😭😭, some day I will, ..But I ended the day on a big win, I'm loving my baldura gate playthrough, much more compared to my last playthrough, this time I told minthara I would raid the grove but didn't ,but I also saved halsin, and the goblin camp was so easy, even the raid fight, zevlor is one of my favorite NPCs, next is to have a party and get my illithid powerss. ..Hmm what else what else today is Ethan's b'day, and Juneteenth, also got a 100 day streak and got to psalm 100..But yeah I'm happy with today's wins, also watched Bob's burgers..Now I'm just watching short stories .

    Entry: Good ish, set up a YouTube channel that I'm pretty happy with tbh, like a new arc, but yeah I still really don't, like know how to handle tough situations that I have no control over, or knowledge on, like when I don't know where someone is, or how someone would react to information, or where my name is being passed around, and like, hypothetical future scenarios and its terrible ;-; and even in the moment I know I'm overreacting or like, the reaction doesn't match the danger, but then I still manage to convince myself that all the scenarios in my head are valid scenarios and then I just feel like hitting my head on a wall, even now, and it , idek how to work on that, trying to silence myself usually..Doesn't work and sometimes, most.times, I just end up shutting down? Like no desire to do anything, just withering away ;-;..I'm gonna choose a random project to work on for my channel, feels weird to say, I also fear like, embarking on a project that just like, wastes my time? But like, I waste my time anyways, and I fear not doing sth better in that time than learning a skill or something I won't use again, but I don't know that, and I might just be dropping myself from a learning opportunity that'll open some doors, and even if not, it might just be for fun, why can't I learn stuff for fun anymore?..Not a very helpful entry, just describing the situation, no solutions to be founded ;-;

    Entry: Ended the day poorly which is a bummer cause it started pretty good, talked a lot with Dr Nafea and he really is a good guy, and like a mentor at this point, he talked to me about reaching out to him if I wanna do a PhD which I'm now considering, he's really knowledgeable in his area, I have met a lotta people ..Richard, Dan, Dr mina, dr dasgupta, ms Johnson, yates, fisher, Dr Hill, nafea, even kalisha, and much more, it's kinda weird ..I'm getting sidetracked tho, talked to Chris and I'll be presenting to the seed students about my research which should be fun, I had a great workout, Ben was there which caught me off guard, we just waved to each other and that was it, I had a banging headache tho, but my workouts have been having my body feeling pumpedddd, like more than any orher routine I've followed and idk why the change is, maybe since I'm doing more high reps, but like my forearms and upper body were so stiff ..Tomorrow we squat!!! I'm still pretty sure from Monday tho, I wish I had a rest day in between ..Gonna start falling asleep soon, it's pretty late. I'm honestly still quite frustrated about a lotta things, anyways I worked on reimbursement and made some great updates, now profs will be able to add receipts by just taking a picture which is sick..Asgards wrath 2 is just whelming, not under or over, just whelmed, also gonna be meeting with Mike and Dr mina mañana, hasta luego

    Entry: Pretty nice day honestly, ended with working on the unity game, I really just wanna make something beautiful xD, worked on the terrain, and was able to get the code to run for the ml Dr Nafea stuff, yay! ..Had a great lower body workout, I underestimated Romanian deadlifts, I just have to not go too low horizontally and my lower back gets pumpedd, but then I was doing stuff like pullups and my legs would be vibrating it's crazy, I also finished delicious in dungeon and it was just okay, but I do enjoy the characters, I slept weird on my.hips and now the right side hurts, I'm also pretty sure that we all have covid now, to varying degrees at least, it's been a while since I had cough, well, maybe not covid but the flu? Who knows..Even played typing racing with the dudes at sunny and it was fun, pretty overall nice day, I'm working more and more on understanding that I'm really just a side character in everyone's story, like when I start thinking for other people, if that makes sense, like at the gym I'd be putting myself in on their characteristics, or their reactions, like I'd try to imagine their reactions, at least from my POV, but again I'm just a side character and I need to lower myself to understanding that others have better things to do with their time than to think about me, even moreso strangers, and it's already slightly helping me worry less about what others think of me? Maybe just because I'm projecting that  onto them, psh whatever ..Looking forward to a great upper day tmmw, also worked a good amount on reimbursement project .

    Entry: Guess who got asgards wrath 3, MEE, Im whelmed with the game, I think red matter 2 had better graphics but I'm just getting started and the combat is looking quite fun, the story is also pretty interesting ..I had a weird dream about pigeon taking over, you know, at those moments where I'm like, in a dream but I'm waking up and just kinda playing out the dream scenarios how I would like it, is that lucid dreaming? It just kinda hit me, like it has happened multiple times and maybe I'm just half awake and imagining everything or maybe! That's just how lucid dreaming feels, who knows, quien sabe. ..Idk how moving to phase two for LM is gonna be, and I worked a teensy bit more on reimbursement today, playing AW2 makes me wanna continue my VR game and dedicate like 2 hours daily to trying to make the best looking game, but then again, like, I got the Ml stuff that ive been slacking on, so tomorrow, we are doing that!! Also the Dr Hill stuff..I've been looking forward to the gym more than usual, I really wanna grow my back and legs, especially legs :*), and I still got my cardio goals, we will see how we I do, we are still on track for making it to Christmas, till I get an email that details everything or sth, we'll see!!!! ..If they manage to pay me and it's like, factored in as a scholarship, best case scenario, I live on campus for a semester,and maybe come home on weekends or sth, if not and everything comes crashing down, then marvelous! Anywaus it's getting late, gonna read some Psalms and go night night

    Entry: I'm pretty sure we all have covid ;-;, feels weird, I did work a lot on the reimbursement today but like Andre hasn't done anything all week and I was looking back and stumbled across old tasks he didn't do and I started getting slightlyy worked up in terms of him slacking/not pulling his weight, and me wanting to be able to work with people who can keep up with me? ..It's sth I've felt before so it's notike a new emotion or sentiment , which then sucks cause then he's also not very good with receiving criticism ughh I thought we had gotten past all this lol, tomorrow, we might go to church, given the sick thing it'll be hard,..Watched a good amount of shows today, kaiju had a new episode which was sick, tried working more with my game idea in unity but the good assets were taken and I didn't really feel it so didn't get much progress on it

    Entry: Mostly chill day today, I can feel another sore throat incoming so gargled some salt water and accidentally swallowed some 😭😭😭😭, my blood pressures getting worse lol, did LM today, a lot, slightly reworked the templates system so it also creates a product on stripe and then is associated with it with a product id and it worked out pretty well, didn't do any work really on reimb, even though I kinda really want to ..I'll dedicate tomorrow to it, I played a lotta Bg3 today tho, a loftt, and I'm at gales arc where he gets the book of thay and then that's what the catalyst is to him becoming a necromancer, I left astarion behind cause he was a burden, I would kinda like a cleric but as of now it is what it is..I was so cloze to giving in but then all the feeling just kinda went away, and it's something I NEED to remember, it's all temporary and I'm back to normal after..I almost forgot to do my weekly report but reminders ftw

    Entry: Omg I had multiple cool dreams, the first one was that I wanted to go to school and I had my own car but wasn't allowed to use it since I couldn't drive but I did it anyways and I can like remember the feeling of driving on my own, even on the highway, And then I remembered I forgot my license and the cars papers so that's how I got caught, and then, I was sitting in someone's car and this dude was talking to small green people, then they started trying to get into the car, but someone else walked up to me like they weren't real and I was on a trip which was weirdddd. ..Then another dream was me in vicsum, like I still remember the place pretty well, and as I was seeing all the other people, like Chinwe, they were shocked that I was back and then I entered the old class and there was like a game thing that I'm pretty sure I won

    Entry: Pretty chill day, Chris introduced me to Hannah, and she's really cool, we were talking about birds reproducing xD, and like, classes and knowledge and it was very interesting, soar was happening, and I wore shorts, and the backside of the shorts were SWEATY WHICH SUCKKKKKKKKED, LIKE, I was enjoying them, then I wasn't 😭, I'm gonna buy more shorts cause I like the feeling of wind on ma legs, then I worked with Mike and it was weird learning someone, like journi vibes slightly without the teaching, I played more on beat saber ost 7 and the songs are such bopppssss. ..I ended the day working on reimbursement partially, I was quite lazy and bum like tho xD, but I'm setting up logging which already looks sick, and notifications, which look amaaaazzinnng, I'm quite happy with how its turning out but tomorrow I'm focusing on final touches with LM..Also stalked Mrs Sophia from vicsum on Facebook, and did some Dr nafea work, that's mainly my days, Dr nafea, dr Hill, Dr mina/bani Taan, but I am very fortunate to be able to work with them

    Entry: Ok so just finished call with Karen and it couldve gone so much worse than it did, it was relatively short and John wasn't there,I confirmed the stripe stuff, and set up search console, then towards the end she started talking about like the documents to send and then she mentioned a W9 which definitely got my attention. And then I was.panicking and prepping lines in my head but then she stepped back from her computer and was like, there we go! She has sent every document,and was.like she'll monitor the progress to make sure UDM got it and that I should make sure UDM finds a way to get the money paid to me, and that essentially it was her that would be turning her W9 form in, and that hopefully God willing at this point it's all set...I was reading psalms earlier today and there was a verse like your anxiety is caused by your lack of faith or belief and it really hit me, and another verse about not being jealous of evil doers and it hit me even double!! We are still on course to make it to Christmas, I washed my face and I'm far from naive enough to say that the worst is in the past, but, I'm gonna put my faith in God and trust that whatever happens is in his hands

And i got the wheels to show woo!..We started kinda the reimbursement project and Dr bani Taan gve me my gift, I also saw Ben today and it wasn't as awkward as I thought

    Entry: Error 400 (Bad Request)!!1400.That’s an error.The server cannot process the request because it is malformed. It should not be retried.That’s all we know. t following that , oh that's nice, j just imagined them asking me to ask my, UGH Non on o. Let's just make it to Christmas, One day at a time, Christmas Is the goal we'll re evaluate then, that's a good 6 more months, i mean 6 months already passed, well,  mean 18 years have already passed what's a good 6 months..Quite a long one today, I don't think I've had one this lengthy ina. While , there's still a few things id like to talk about, I think my brothers trip to Cali did a lot for me too, cause id be home alone and doing things like singing and whistling and trying my best to do it, but then there was this specific Moment that I caught myself like, hm, I'm still doing these things I like, and that whenever he's around, my brain tells me that I do it to like, show off , or like prove something? Even if there's nothing to prove, but i still found myself doing those things, so it dawned on me that it's not because of him, or like, other people, that I do things, like me imagining other people around me when playing beat saber, well, that's just fun, but like, I do those things because I enjoy them, and the thought of others being around Is an After thought and are often never the reason why i do such things, well, they're rarely the reason, sometimes they are, I'm not going to lie to myself, but I also know that now if I'm doing something and then my brain tells me that I'm only doing XYZ because Y is there, then im now much more confident in being like, no, I did this for myself and even though my brains diverting to that person, it doesn't mean that ..That's where my intentions lie, and with that i can often do what I'm doing with more peace of mind, and it's also slowly transferring to others in the sense that im working on being more aware that im really Just and NPC in other people's lives, like, i'm thinking of the way my dad sees me and it's like, he really doesn't know that much about me, and he really doesn't Need to?  Or have a reason to in the same way that it's vice versa, to other people, i'm someone innthe background, Just like they are people in the background to me ..This was a nicely cathartic entry that somehow still leaves me feeling bad and uncertain, but more relief about putting it all on here, we just need to make it till Christmas

    Entry: I kinda don't wanna start out with this but I still haven't reached out to Karen, but I'll reach out to her on Monday, can't like, rewind time but I'm sure she's busy, okay so now we are done with that ..we went to the Japanese restaurant, or like, the fancy place we went on our mom's bday, it was very nice, had a lot to eat, soup, salad, didn't have my Rangoons :(, but I had dumplings, plus sushi!! It was actually pretty good, and medium well steak with steamed rice, honestly really nice, there was a family in front of us and the wife of the dude was like (to my mum) that we were really well behaved, and honestly i think She might've Just been joking or sarcastic 😭😭, or maybe not, cause we were saying thank you a lot, and i do wonder how it was built into I.Us to do that, idk, id like to raise like a bobs burger family lol. But yeah, it was cool, I have some leftover sushi. ..Then spent time playing crosswords, also did some ML lessons today, focused on neural Networks and like the math and calculation behind them and I've gotten a better grasp of the weights and how they essentially pair up with the inputs. ..Watched some american dad on tv and honestly a pretty good show , also apparently we are gonna start going to church, we'll see how it goes. I'm kinda looking forward to it but we'll see, that's all I have tho, i was gonna get into a whole thing about self reflection vs self awareness, and also side note ben had presented at the conference and dr bani Taan was there too .

Also started another Bg3 playthrough and i love my characters design, she's like, rugged and doesn't want to get too attached, she's a tiefling and She did push away shadowheart but welcomed astarion wow i sound like a nerd, but im enjoying giving her actual values, ugh my head feels so heavy ..Creappp I should probably reach out to Karen and John cause She hasn't responded so im like, yeah she's prolly very busy, can't blame her, no skin off my back or something

    Entry: Just got very, very humbled today, was reading some reddit comments and people giving advice and like, people being like, their XX died, and they lost their car and it's like, it's like dang, I can only relate on a miniscule level to being like not knowing what to do with yourself, and now i wanna read le mythe de sisyphe because someone recommended it but noope Ive downloaded the japenese and the french version ;-;. ..But like, there was also this dude sleeping in a park in Malaga Spain and it's like, surreal, cause I can kinda imagine how they must be feeling on that bench surrounded by the darkness knowing a buncha strangers on the internet are rooting for them. I hope they'll be okay. But yeah it is very humbling (side note, Karen hasn't responded), and even now i fear getting to a point in my life where like i'm going through something as Bad as what they're going through, And it's terrifying, cause it could always be worse, like what if someone I care about, like, i dont even want to think of that as a possibility, it's, like geez, right now I'm only 18 and honestly it feels like a lotta my major Life events have happened over the last 5 years, and it feels so long, but I know in the future everything would feel like a blur..Idk why this is turning out to be a philosophical day, i spent the entire day not making any progress in dr Hill code and didn't even get to do any dr nafea stuff blech. Didn't even follow my brother to work out cause i just felt, annoyed, about not having a car and all..May 29 has successfully passed! Tomorrow's my brothers bday and we are almost halfway through the year dang

    Entry: Don't get used to this! I still have some things i Need to process, but today was a crab rangoon day, and i made some more progress on dr Hill stuff so I'm cutting myself some slack. I was able to order, 6 crab Rangoons! Actually maybe 8? Nah i think they put 3, and they were delishhh, saves some more for tomorrowwww, plus rice and chimken. ..Did the dr nafea stuff and dr bani Taan was there but thank God he had to leave for a meeting cause I didn't know if he knew that I got the ESD scholarship, im sure he's swamped with emails and 29 Is tomorrow WOO. Hmm, i worked out, it was fun, and saw margo, congratulated her on her powerlifting meet, Sarwar picked me up and started reading psalms, played a bit of cards and tankards, I'm hoping to get the robots spawned in by tomorrow 🥹🥹, if nothing ends up working, at least now i have a much better understanding of whats happening and where to go, at least much better than when I started ..In terms of the things i need to process, sadly it's official, my relationship with Ben has reached the stage of, i Need to give it a name, it has realllly only happened twice, with my brother and now him, it's like, crap that sucks, and now i have to deal with the things that comes with it, bit Even more crap is that THIS is what I'm worrying about. Since the start of the month worrying or talking about dumb stuff like this seems so, trivial? Inconsequential? It kinda sucks. But yeah I now kinda had an epiphany that maybe it's not envy i'm feeling? The internet had nothing, it's like, fear that the person may surpass You, and May already have, leaving me inadequate and now wanting to compensate to prove myself to them? I'll choose, glorb glorb, because why not, it's my emotion I get to choose the name! I felt glorb glorb omg this is so stupid xD, later today, cause on LinkedIn ben and omaran were going back and forth (well, like once) on AI stuff and then like we had our meeting with Dr Nafea and I'm really learning a lot, and there's still so much I wanna do, dang i really hope I can get dr Hills stuff to work 😭😭😭😭, tomorrow Is another day!..I've also been enjoying stuff like crosswords, but yeah that's like my day, srwar offered to give me like his proteín drink thingys which is pretty cool of him :D, time to go to bed!!

Even though I didn't mix the ingredients well and i think I ate a clump of baking soda/powder, tomorrow i'm following Sarwar again and i like it tbh, and i get to workout RAAA, kinda hyped. ..Time for bed

That I did something wrong and like, it would be insecure and like, payments wouldn't work or something would break , I'm mostly worried about getting stripe wrong, even though writing it now, my worries are  kinda calming down cause realistically, i think I did pretty good and like, God willing the code Just works, but like, I wasn't mentally prepared xD, i still am not, for a launch, Deep breaths ..Also tell me why i showed up for the meeting 30 mins late cause i was playing cards and tankards 😭😭😭😭😭, but BUT i thought it was Thursday so don't blame me 😭😭 and i was having a fairly Nice day, made Apple pie while watching whisper of the Heart, great show...I'm gonna ask mantas for help so he can look over the code and like, give me his stamp of approval, im like excited nervous cause on one hand, im dealing with payments in the 100s of dollars, so rn I'm relying on stripe, but I'm also excited cause i'm launching my first ever software built from scratch with like fairly advanced features, thinking of it that way gets me excited but there's also the nervousness there. ..She didn't talk about the new project cause she was waiting for everything to be done, which is honestly fine with me. I hope ESD dont contact dr bani Taan to try to get to me but thank God he's in china and i hope he stays there till May 29😭😭, rn tho, i'm getting a headache but deep breaths, gonna work on the changes, and we'll go from there

    Entry: Drawing a note from my end of year entries, I'm gonna essentially give a rundown of where I am in different categories of mh Life, ..Emotions..- in terms of emotions, it's very high and low, like, today I received news that I got the ESD scholarship, Amazing news! Thank God for the opportunity, unfortunately i have to fill out a W9 form, so i didn't do anything with it, it's sitting in my emails and i haven't even told my parents yet. Even writing it now I really really want someone to talk to it about and vent, writing here helps but i desperately want to offload on someone and i can feel of all bottling up inside and soon I'll start crying lol ( i don't feel like crying now but I feel like if I started talking to someone, id cry ), but like yeah, it's 2000 dollars and honestly feels like a prestigious award, they've been doing it since 1953, that's insane, but i survived without it and I'll keep surviving. I learned that john - Giraldi - is also a professor at UDM, so dr mina  being in contact with them, and having both of them on the team makes more sense and makes me feel slightly more comfortable, i should send a message to John asking for like advice on the tech side and stuff so he can feel involved....But still thinking about how im gonna get paid, it's so much better now, but admittedly I'm still working on Just being able to surrender everything to God, as i have no control over what Is happening or what is going to happen. 0 control so deep breaths. Not being able to get the scholarship really loweres my mood but i played cards and tankards and it perked me right up lol, being able to randomly talk to strangers is nice, even had a fun while and played like 4 games with this dude and i was getting all the great cards it was amazing, we friended each other so i do hope to see him around, SQRIFTY or something, i gotta hurry and stop getting sidetracked or I'll never finish this journal lol ..Health ..I'm excited to start the raiders program by bald omniman!! Its four days a week, but i believe my brother works out four days a week so I'm just gonna start following him, i also asked my mum about sarwar taking me and it's a go, well, it started with conversation about a car, so we'll see. It's not something I've talked about but my eye is back to normal thank God, no more feeling like there's something lodged in it ..Wealth ..No Money ;-;, lol, except from the YTE stuff, i do with what i have and im a man of low physical needs ..Job..Work Is going fine tbh, i went to school today for a photoshoot and gave my robot face fo Meghann, which i think She enjoyed, so that's cool, met Nate, which I think Is dr Pauliks son? Idk, he's nice too ..Faith ..Gotta read the bible so I'm rushing through this entry xD ..Relationships ..Most relationships are fine, i haven't been Active in the fitness server and unfortunately it's kinda dying but it is what it is, it's weird to think that i'm the only one having issues with Ben, we haven't talked in like 3 weeks which is prolly the longest since we've really known each other? Or at least since the duck, and it's weird to say but like, it is what it is, i'm sure the conversation Will be brought up eventually, but we'll see, let tomorrow worry about itself ..Goals/plans ..Feeling pretty, goalless? Maybe? Since these days have the vibe of i can't control the future, it's like, why plan? Honestly i'm just trying to get it to next semester, keep it all together, don't make any waves, just keep my head down and keep moving.....General motivation ..Blech describes it pretty nice, I have ideas for side projects like the VR stuff , but like, blech, sometimes/a lotta times, it feels like I'm not in the right headspace to do anything. Overall, yeah this month really beat me up, we ain't even a month into the Summer, I'll keep moving, surviving

    Entry: Had some meh moments where i was just half functioning but overall good day, finally had the conversation about me getting a car, dang this probably means that I'm gonna be the one getting water on Saturdays lol, if I'm scared of that, then i have no chance driving so I just gotta suck it up, i also gotta demo the robot thingamajig tomorrow, so, that's fun, CRAP i didn't do the program, im doing it now!..Also played Sky in beta and it was telling the story of how Sky came to be and I'm kinda motivated to make a small vr game!..Also fixed the legalmeasure bugs today, and Karen hasn't sent anything, meaning she may have sent it to the wrong email so I'm gonna email tomorrow. Hmm, yeah I'm setting up my program now, ciao

    Entry: Honestly I am on the verge of feeling "great", the pressure/worry/stress of everything in general Is fading away and i spent most of the day just enjoying like, VR or Bob's burgers or writing tests for legal measure 😭, got some DANG JUST FOUND A BUG, okay set reminder to fix that lol, but yeah I did some logging and wrote tests, I had a really cool experience in VR that i'm gonna talk about..My younger brother cleaned the walls of the kitchen, and dang idk why I'm kinda thinking about planning moving out lol, this is the first and prolly last time you're gonna hear about it this year cause I don't even have a car, but like, Lukas was talking about renting a house and it looked pretty cheap, well, decent,as long as i have a good job, so likeee. ..Oh! The experience, the lay down feature finally came out or at least im just discovering it and First did some lying down karaoke, actually first, before finding the feature, tried Maloka, a meditating app which was great and calmed me down, and even tried fishing! In VR lol, but then I got to big screen beta, did karaoke, then First skipped past the Bible study room, then went back into it and it was a buncha people, kids even who were talking about Jesus and the Bible and blue letter bible was pulled up and like, idk they were asking questions that made me think and it was just an experience that i never thought i would have if that makes sense, idk it's cool. ..I'll ask the group abut messaging dr mina about starting on the reimb project, also, talked with Jared today as well and he recommended some music, talked a lot in Sunny, that's about it for my day tho. It's gonna be halfway through 2024 soon, and honestly rn it does feel long, but ik in a few days it's gonna be like no time passed by..Also love dadish lol

    Entry: Really just chilled this weekend, it was nice, everytime i felt myself starting to worry, I took deep breaths and just repeated leave it to God, it worked  really well, being like, can I control what's going to happen, no, then I shouldn't worry about it, and After a few more deep breaths, I'm.back to normal, it's like a hack lol and its allowing me not to wallow in despair worry and dread, which is amazing! ..In all seriousness it is really helping me keep myself together, take things as they come, and even when i do think about it, sometimes! Rarely, but still appreciated, like rn, instead of focusing on how petrified I am, or Will be, i just focus on the good outcome/ending, which is always nice. Tomorrow can worry about itself, today already has enough problems. I'm gonna keep chugging like this till Thursday and we have our LM meeting, which speaking of which, i was able to fix some bugs and clean up some stuff which I'm happy with, still gonna work more on it tomorrow tho, mainly spent today playing cards and tankards, watching Bob's burgers and YouTube , which by the way, MUNECAT UPLOADED, like what!!!!! Haven't finished the video yet tho but it's about evolutionary psychology ..Pise watched and finished akudama drive and he likes it! But no longer trusts me recommending shows 😭😂..I worked on the site that scrapes YouTube and pulls out the transcript and honestly it Is coming along quite nicely, okay i'm off to read Isiah, I don't think I've read it before but it looks like there's some good wisdom in it

    Entry: I mean, I guess I'm feeling better, Just did a quick prayer praying for God to guide me, guide my Heart in making the right decisions and guide the hearts of others around me, may His Will be done, when I say that, part of me then gets worried that His will is not the Will that i want, like it's one that will cause some humanly suffering, and my screen Is acting weird so I cant fully go into it, but i know that his Will Is good, He Is good and whatever happens was meant to happen. I pray that he Will strengthen me and guard my heart to make decisions that Honor Him, i pray that he guides the heart of others and softens their heart. ..Oh something just occured, there Is a chance that with when my financial aid package rolls by, that's when the Money Will be added to my account, i don't know but it's possible. I pray that God does what he sees fit, and I pray for the ability to leave everything in his hands, total surrender ..I remember jokingly asking for something to test my faith, and i think this past month honestly has been a Big doer of that, it's challenging who I am as a person, what i can handle and how i handle stressful situations. ..Also mu Brother is back from California, thank God for a safe trip, i made more lentils and watched more Bob's burgers and even started coding a small side project to take my mind off things..Also there's that - ..https://www.reddit.com/r/funnyvideos/s/TsIkSyDMlW..But now I'm heading to bed , right now I'm gonna work on taking Deep breaths and Just imagining everything floating up to him, giving him control and taking it off my mind .

    Entry: I'm pensive again, idk how to feel and like i'm thinking but not about anything in particular, just had our reimbursement meeting with dr mina and like at the start She was talking about me getting paid and i wanted to make or very clear that I didn't want to get paid if it wasn't tuition remission, and then she talked about like, if I'm in a positive or something and I don't really care about all that and told her that as long as it covers my tuition then I'm fine with not getting paid, and I think she got the memo at least that i don't want to get paid, and she was like I should reach out to her and she wo.Would speak to the admin for me but that's only if I reach out to her and ask, so I believe that as it stands, she was talking about all the paper work for the Ann arbor Spark and that she met with Karen two weeks ago and was very excited to keep working with me and like, geez, God is sending a lot of opportunities my way, and in every other circumstance I'd be so happy, but rn it's like suffering from success lol. Hmmm, being in the third week of summer already seems so quick even though it kinda isnt, but like, idk what my reaction now should be, relief? Indifference? Continual suffering and pressure of the unknown? Dread??? All of the above, idk how to react so maybe i Just, won't?..Is that stupid, idk, it's like, idk what to expect, idk what's coming, idk what the future holds for me, i truly can't control anything, well, I really haven't been able to control anything from the get go. Worrying about it and even thinking about it gets me nowhere, sometimes I just wanna shout or punch things cause like idk, idk, there's a lot of frustration, what ifs, fears, dread, unknowns, like what if Ann arbor Spark doesn't actually want to pay it into my account as tuition remission, what if i have to go to a meeting with them and then discuss my situation, what if karen wants to pay me directly, what if,  and i just go down this cycle and even Just thinking about it makes me feel worse and I'm back to Square One, if i ignore it, I feel stupid, if i focus on it, i feel terrible, there's always some hope lingering there that one day it'll Just be magically taken out of my account, and there's gonna be more Money than i Need in my account which is fine, and then i tell Karen that I can't and can only really do phase 2 or maybe can't even .Do phase 2, or She asks me if ive gotten paid and i Say no, or asks me to explain my *situation*, what ifs what ifs what ifs, it's causing an intense amount of stress and uncertainty and worry and now I'm just repeating myself, like, how did I end up here,what if i just drop everything, stuff like that UGH..Edit..I feel like I'm now in the final stage of acceptance? Like, I'm looking up visas to live in Spain lol and it doesn't look that hard, whatever happens happens, leave things in the hands of God

    Entry: I had an amazing dream, it was days of rainbow and i was in a classroom with a bunch of people that actually didn't recognize and like it was at night and there were things like activities for us to do and like different wing colors, the only conflict was a girl that did an Activity to get pregnant but didn't, i know sounds weird, but we quickly solved that, and nastymold was there! And She said we could vent where of we turn for like 10 seconds and then retrm back to normal, we shoot out a rainbow that like signifies letting the anger go, and I really needed that, it was really fun

    Entry: Just got done fixing a few bugs in legalmeasure, One really big bug on Edge, and for one, i am happy that I got to fix it, i even did it while watching Bob's burger on the TV, the downside is I used ai for the mongo exponential backoff and i feel dirty like since it's not my code, I'm losing trust in myself and my code, which is never a good thing, it's not the first time I'll feel like this and it's not the last time. I'm still like, not quite over everything, i think everything hinges on the meeting next Thursday and i can't really do anything till then than chug along. ..Dr Hill told me about some robotics presentation thingy on Tuesday and that he might invite ben, idk why he's always mentioning Ben around me 😭😭, i hope ben says no , if not, then my messages from a few days back Will have to be put to the test. I was watching this wedding scene with my dad, or just side by side with him, and like, idk I was feeling Happy for the people imagining their Joy, like good for them, why can't I feel like this for people I know 😭

    Entry: Def pensive, I'm not feeling as bad as I did but im hanging by a thread to not spiral into what ifs, so I'm just going to focus on the best case scenario, which i think Is where Karen has done all she needs for the contract and it's off her hands, and like, nothing happened with it or it got lost and i never got paid which I'm fine with, or she's just like it's still processing but Im sure she has done what she needs. ..In terms of the next project, I'll just say no, I feel motivation swelling, just say no, I should make that a mantra or a chant, i know, i pray, I'll feel better soon enough, honestly I could even cut out doing phase 2...and crap i gotta go to campus tomorrow. Everything Will be fine..Crap dr Hill messaged me about fixing the robot ugh, i should just say no..also my back hurts cause bad posture during the meeting

    Entry: I had a moment of growth today! Well, kinda, I realized that my parents aren't just there to say no to the things I wanna do, which idk really how to explain it normally when i picture myself asking them about or for something, I'm usually just imagining that they'll say no and that'd be the end of it, like that's the default reaction, so much that i wouldn't even ask, like small things tho like asking my mum to make meat pie for like the ACSO club or something. ..my younger brother asked her to make jollof rice plus coleslaw and she's doing it and even did the same for meat pie in the past i believe, it's like, same with me going to fall getaway and my brother going to California, which honestly is still weird to say and think about! but it's a mental barrier that I have to overcome and have to learn to just ask. i don't think I can travel anywhere regardless cause I can't do the CRU stuff, but like, maybe Colombia next year? I highly doubt it but whatever happens, I'm still going to fall getaway 😤😤😤. ..omg i still have such fond memories, playing euchre with Ethan, gong outside on the swing and just looking at the stars, memories making me wanna cry lol..I also went to school today and feel quite stylish, Margo released her video about the powerlifting combine and in my part She was like "remember him" or something, and idk, it made/makes me feel nice inside, like a very condensed compliment that i still have a lot to achieve, making me feel motivated, dang now I gotta change my mood this really upped me. ..The whole stuff with Ben is still like, there, but it's not going to affect me seriously anytime soon, i'm just nervous abot when we Will run into each other but that's for future me to decide, worst case scenario, we ignore each other, Best case scenario, anything other than that, win win...Went to school today which was cool, worked out and my legs are soooore, learning about CNNs now, slowly. Google had their eventi and chat gpt hot 4o is still blowing my mind. Anyways it's late si I gotta sleep!!..Call with Karen tomorrow, Wish me luck!!

    Entry: I think i would put pensive as my mood of it was a mood, honestly it's pretty much usually how I feel when I say im unsure. ..I'm pensive because I've been asking myself whether I have the right to be angry at Ben, ik I thought I was over it but like now that the reimbursement project is resurging Andre was like - so it's just the three of us now, and Ethan was like, at least we know it's all aras fault and ik he was joking but then it got me thinking and getting slightlyyy worked up cause i was/am now thinking back to all the things he said "to try to hurt me' which writing it now, feels different, cause now idk if he was actually saying or doing those things with the intention to hurt me, and me rolling with that idea that he was saying, well, he did say some hurtful things on purpose so hes not totally off the hook!  ..But yeah ive been going in with the assumption that the things he said were truly to hurt me where that isn't necesariily  the case. Now idk where i was going with that line of thought :(, but yeah, idk whether to just leave things as it is and when we see each other whatever happens happens, we will see each other eventually, and i could either just act like nothing happened, confront him in person to explain himself, ignore him? Or at least avoid as much as possible, or just see how he reacts first and go based on that. Honestly either the last or the first one, you'll definitely know how it goes qndnhow oír relationship Will continue from now on

Home alone, opened the windows, just chilled and did some work, didn't follow my schedule but I realized that it was causing me more worry/stress than helping, it definitely does help and I'm keeping it close to make sure that i always know what i have to do ..Oh highlight of the day!!! I shaved, my moustache 😂😂, it was literally barely anything but I look different!! And weird 🤣,different weird but also i don't dislike it, I think it makes me look younger so I might make it a habit xD. Also, played some vr and a lotta Shadow fight, some chess , my brothers in California so I get the bed to myself!gotta go to school tomorrow tho..Also cleaned a bunch and started and finished tower of god, amazingggg anime

    Entry: I'm feeling very raro, my parents just left to drive my brother to the Airport and like I can feel how it'd feel to be experiencing something like that and I can't say that I don't want to be the One feeling that way but at the same time i enjoyed my night and guess wouldn't want to take away him experiencing that and wishing it was just mine, ..Also finished watching frieren today, and I tried watching mha and then ninja kamui and even kaiju no 8 but they all pailed to it in somle way, the animation, the story, the characters, the soundtrack, idk, the vibes, it's weird, I got very comfy with the characters..I do pray for a safe trip for my brother and my parents, my dad said he was tired and if he's the One driving which gives me cause for worry but God willing they all reach and return to their destination safely. I also have been talking to Jared a lot more, maybe even more than Andre x Ethan, and I'm learning stuff like he journals, for three years Even, and doesn't wanna have kids, I'm kinda looking forward to speaking more with him over the school year. Also watched Bob's burgers and had the supplements app call and the site Is looking Just not that great, but idk if i have the Heart to say It, i prolly will eventually...I also played beat saber and found a buncha sick maps, you know, I'm still looking back to the internship incident and like, wondering how it's just off my mind now, feels like nothing had happened and I'm back to my normal self, no sulking, no terror and fear. Believe me I'm not complaining, it just feels strange, we adapt quickly i guess. Another weird thing I realized playing beat saber and remembered when my brother got his phone all those years back in mind builders and i was crying in the car, I realized that I'd never do something like that these days and that I've really grown, and then I realized that was like a decade ago, but still!!! The sentiment changes, from crying to squeezing paper to overcompensating to compensating to silent reflection, and even though it's sometimes hard to maintain facial expressions, and my heart races, maybe they're remnants of their time. Dang that finale made no sense, also, dang I forgot what I was gonna say, also prolly gonna wait till my parents get back before I go to bed ..Oh i also worked on the presentation for Dr Nafea and I'm happy with my progress..Also added a new activity for whenever i feel a change in my mindset or when I realize that ive grown in some way, its gonna be rare but it's gonna be here when i need it...I really pray today isn't a day that'll negatively define the rest of my life..Also first time sleeping with a hair bonnet!

I'm mostly tired rn, mostly, I was reflecting on my diving more into Christianity and I found it to be a good thing as it's showing me that I'm not stagnant in my faith and at least in continuing to move forward..My screen time today Is definitely abysmal, something that surprised me was that Jared texted! He's been making more of an effort than I am so im def gonna work on talking more with him. ..Did some work today and I'm already feeling drained again blech, it's not as bad as the end of the semester but I'm like, geez I have a good amount of stuff to do! And four hours of today feels so small but I imagine the 4 hours of yte to be longer, idk watching frieren Is kinda messing up my perception of time in a good way, it's a great anime ..Two times today, one when I asked sarwar about submitting his report like 30 seconds after, and another checking my sent email and then almost instantaneously dr Nafea responds, made me feel psychic lol, also me mispelling phase 1 updates as phase 1 pdates in my email to Karen and John 😭😭😭😭, good thing I didn't CC dr mina lol ..I'm getting better and gaining a much better grasp on understanding the ML fundamentals, and I'm kinda happy about it and i Hope It sticks. The stuff i ordered also comes tomorrow!! Yayy..Oh I also Watched some Simpsons today, also found a cursed subreddit..Oh snap I crossed my 4 year anniversary of journalling a few days ago!!!

    Entry: I'm looking to use tomorrow as a chill day, and i gotta email Karen and john, cause I'm already ready for another break LOL, another break as in i feel my plate Is pretty full and i don't wanna get overwhelmed at like the second week of the summer. ..Hmmm, what else, MY FAITH IS STRUGGLING BRO 😭😭, YouTube was, well, i somehow stumbled on some videos about historical evidence of Christianity and Jesus existing and i know it Is a fact that Jesus existed, and now understanding and believing that he was divine and resurrected and the authenticity of the Bible, so i don't wanna close off the critical thinking of my brains but i know that when I pray, i pray to someone and i pray to God, and like, it's this weird dissonance and i think it's the devil playing games 😭..AND i did work out, and Michael was there, and wow i really really do Need to get my Heart healthy 😭😩😩..I also made lentils again

    Entry: Just saw a Red winged blackbird, northern cardinal, and a Hawk of some sort in the past like 30 minutes, I've been looking up stuff related more and more to whether Jesus existed, and it's essentially a fact that he did exist, and now im looking more and more into the bibleso we'll see how it goes, and maybe all this Is a sign, Who knows!

    Entry: Is craving a close intimate relationship an emotion 🥹🥹, i was watching a random YouTube video about dating red flags in Spain and watching Italian x Spain videos and i started this show called El juego de los llaves and ita a very sinful x lustful show 😭 so i should stop it, it's a Nice practice for my Spanish but I can just find another way..So to the craving relationship part, idek I'm just 18 and like, idk should I get on a dating site 😭, even if just to find Friends, I prolly won't and its prolly a fleeting emotion, we'll see how it goes, i'm definitely feeling the emotion rn tho, more than a friend relationship, idk, one part of me was like maybe I could find It with God, and to that I say, maybe. ..I'm watching Christian TikTok and now trying to surround myself with as much christian content as possible, it's giving me the same feeling as during fall getaway, but like, much lesser , it's very much better than nothing. Still reading Matthew and the sermon on the mount morning and night, tried to follow my schedule and diverted a bit but still ended up accomplishing essentially what I wanted to. I def should've read a paper so I could have sth to say with dr nafea, gonna do that tomorrow morning, early start to the day i suppose. I also worked on dr Hill stuff and was able to get the offline code running, nothing with Simulation or ROS yet tho, so we'll see 😭, it looks like it's gonna be a hassle...Also got on a call with oriekaose for the supplements app and got some UI design work in, gonna work more on that tomorrow, then gonna work more on dr Hill stuff..I gotta ask my parents about carpooling with Sarwar, oh dang how is it this late already, gotta start heading to bed . Also made lentils which honestly turned it really nice

    Entry: Gonna journal now in case it gets long and i wanna go to bed before 11 30, I downloaded a schedule app that I'll be using to track my schedule and if I don't get to setting it up tonight, Imma do it tomorrow. Anyways, to journaling ..I went to school today and spent a good amount of time there, the meeting with Dr nafea went well and I enjoyed it, even worked on the dr Hill stuff by setting up the simulations and was able to run it in under an hour..I learned that ben is also working for Dr Nafea, meaning there's a chance we will run into each other over the summer, which i don't  look forward to, idk what's the best way to combat this, not alone that's for sure, like i'm feeling the same way towards him now as i feel to my brother, which honestly has gotten better. And like, i'm thinking about him learning and like, making stuff and idk why I'm scared of him succeeding, its a trend with honestly not just him but a good majority of people i come across, WHAT JS WEONG WITH MEEEEE, ughhhhhhhhhh, this is something that I feel like I've made no progress in over the years, maybe I should talk to Andy or Dan about It..I'll come back to that, Andre was telling me about his mum and it's like, I feel really bad for him, it's like she's just eating away at him piece by piece and i feel second hand bad for him, id hate to be in that position m, why can i sympathize with people who are in despair but not celebrate those who succeed ;-;, neither of them really affect my state of being, maybe i should make a YouTube channel and share It with the world lol, it feels like sth I'll never surpass, ans idk if that's true or not, it's stupid, just a few days ago i was in despair about losing all that ive worked for/towards and being apprehensive of the future and now I'm complaining about not feeling Happy for others success, i have a headache... ..I also took my blood pressure and It was like 138/75 so we have to make some freaking changes, like, actual changes, i have to start figuring out a healthy meal system cause we have a lotta oil and now I'm realizing a Lot of salt. I also have to get my cardio in which ive been scared of the gym on campus for some reason, ive also maybe taken up the challenge of reading the sermon on the mount everyday? Twice, in the morning and night. Ill give it a go, it's packed with information snd kniwkedge and i believe the only way i can realistically get over all my blabbing above is ti act like a Christian, if that makes sense..Also finished the Boys! Again, it's really well written

    Entry: I gotta go to school tomorrow! 🥺🥺, idk if sarwar is taking me tho, anyways, I followed my schedule today! And it was pretty productive honestly, but the next like quarter of the day was me being very lazy xD, and now I'm watching bon qui qui and MAD television. I did do some ML studying and learning more about gradient descent and now I'm trying to fully understand it, at least more now, I'm gonna see how much my schedule changes when I'm on campus, I reached out to Dr Hill too and he said sounds good, so I think I start working for him? ..Anyways gonna be working tomorrow, well, in the meeting with Dr Nafea tomorrow but the start of my day will still stay the same, I mean, I'll be in school so I can still do legalmeasure stuff..I made pancakes! And I'm almost done with dorohedoro, which I started earlier today xD

    Entry: Hopped on sky beta cause I saw a cool looking place and it was like a meditation place and I took deep breathes and now Im calm and weak xD, very docile. ..Highlight of the day, essentially little work was done! But work was done, worked on Oee, legalmeasure, worked with MailChimp which was surprisingly easy, also implemented essentially all her changes, now I have to fine tune things and honestly write tests ..I want to buy an Arduino and do a project that'll be like an automatic air freshener but I'm kinda hesitant and idk why, it's pretty cheap I assume and it'll be a fun learning opportunity, idk idk, I don't wanna give up on the idea tho, maybe if the smell gets bad enough. ..Then did the ml course and watched the videos on the cost function and went further than I had in the past, woo! ..I also feel motivated to make a plan for my summer, my actual summer that starts tomorrow! I've gotten the grunge and despair out of my system, all it took was hours of mindless shorts, reddit and good cards and tankards. ..Creating my schedule now..Wake up: 8am max (my body can very much time it for me. ..8:05 am: Drink water, a full cup! Get the juices flowing..Read bible; 8:10, specifically starting at mark. If need be, get your chunky bible and start annotating ..I think there is little I could do that would give me the peace of mind and hope that comes with being close to God, surrendering whatever happens to him, and even though I can start feeling like I'm doing all that as an excuse, like a cop out, I think I still know my true intentions, and that's why apologetics is going to be a big thing for this summer, especially since I've been struggling more and more with doubt. Hmm actually I might combine apologetics time with reading the Bible? But I also want to split it up throughout the day so I wouldn't for now, just to test things out ..Note: Reading can also be supplemented by listening to Bible project, not necessarily watching YouTuber commentary for now ..9:00 Do everything to get off your mind. Vacuum, shower, lay the bed, make breakfast, making this 45 minutes so I have enough time for everything, and make nutritious breakfasts! No more plantain or oils or cheese or grease, ur heart can't take it!..Well I guess I have to eat so I can honestly eat and read, that way I'll have some reading time too..10:00 Start work with first watching the machine learning videos, paying close attention, no shadow fight!! Maybe, no no, no shadowfight, gotta be deep learning lol..10:45 Transition to the Dr. Nafea research aspect of things, doing the tasks, readings etc ..12:00: An hour free time, spend as you like! Preferably a beat saber workout or cards and tankards, or shadowfight ,or baking! I know this routine will change on the days I'm on campus but I can still try to stick to it as much as possible ..1:00 Work on LegalMeasure, I'm still tied up about not chickening out, I really am, and I don't think Karen is an employee, I mean, I'm technically just making a website for a company collaborating with the law school, even though I don't really see much collaboration there 😭😭, this is the peace of mind I'm lacking cause of not chickening out, part of me is really only worried about the payment going through, it has been TEN WEEKS, ish,actually, mode like 13 weeks or sth, I don't think I'm getting paid, which honestly I'm fine with, it's like a don't ask don't tell kinda thing, so I'm fine with all that, and I doubt anything would change over the next few weeks since it has been that long, wow tangent much, but yeah 1 hour! ..2:00: Work on OEE, we gotta dedicate time to working on it so it's as good as possible! That way we can start getting monetized faster ..3:00 Work on the sports supplement site, I suppose, it is what it is ..4:00 Back to apologetics,  there are so many hours in the day I'm realizing, so many little small things take up that time ..4:30 Free time/make lunch and stuff..5:00: Find a pet project to work on! Maybe its Nix, or truenas, who knows, have fun...7:00: Honestly more free time, an hour of reading perhaps, then free time! I don't think I've missed anything as far as my schedule goes, RN if I'm going be doing 20 hours a week for Dr Hill, I could do like Tues Weds Thurs on campus, I'm like, down with that honestly, and I would be working on his stuff and working on putting my full effort into it! ..I think this sounds like a plan, I'm def gonna be checking in here to cross reference and maybe putting it on Google calendar or sth but let's get this bread! ..Also sleeping at 11:30, sharp , gonna move that up to 11 slowly but eventually

    Entry: So yeah, I did make the changes following the meeting, which was pretty good, no quitting for me yet ":), I guess that's like, about it? I'll see how far I can go, no tuition remission. Payment but im hoping it pulls through, thank God no one has sent me anything to fill out, and Dr Hill knew about it somehow, idk if I told him! ..One thing in the Dropbox, there was someone invited who may have made a webflow site in the past but they're switching away from it? Idk there's nothing on it so I don't think anything came out of it 😭, it seems like they had been trying to deploy it a while ago, like 6 months ago even, idk why they'd just be getting funding now, idk idk ...My parents went to a party of some kind, now just listening to baldurs gate music and it rained earlier...It feels weird, I feel normal, normal enough now, as if the past few days didn't happen but I still feel the remnants of fear and doubt and unease. If I was still in the same state, I would NOT have chickened out of stepping down with LM, my parents just came back talking about how bad the service was and there was no food xD..Funnily enough I was just watching Bob's burgers then imagining how the food service people would be reacting being overwhelmed ..Idk though,its also weird, idk why but I've been feeling like there's nothing to live for? Or look forward to, which are two very different things,but like, I do feel a loss of my sense of purpose, like I'd be thinking that if something happened to me, I wouldn't care because there's really nothing there for me, and then I'm thinking about the decisions now wondering just how bad I'm screwing myself over in the future and just how much worse it could become, and it sucks! Because now I'm thinking about when everything gets settled with the green card and stuff and imagining the two reactions, which like, idk, what if everything goes to crap before hand, like, straight to the gutter, idk, stuff like that combined with my recent desire to not do much is honestly making me wonder if I'm depressed, BUT I very much doubt that, very much doubt it, and idk how things are going to change over the next few weeks, next few weeks being like over the next year? Actually even in the next few weeks, the next month? Two months? No idea, no idea...Whatever happens

    Entry: I CHICKENED OUT UGHHH, John wasn't there and it was just me and Karen and I got weak and she already talked about knowing I was busy and phase 1 technically isn't really done yet and I'm like trying to rationalize that I'm just making a website in collaboration with the law school, no big deal, but like idk 😭😭😭 and like Dr mina said it'll be tuition remissions and now I have like a false sense of comfort but idk if that's me being dumb 😭, ..I mean I can always schedule my time according to how busy I get, and they were talking about doing co op with the NLP stuff which is a possibility so idk, maybe my work will be much more.lessened, maybe if I see Dr mina in person, I'll ask her about the status of the contract and I'm just hoping it really is tuition remission and my mind would only really be calm when I see the money out of my tuition

    Entry: Talked to Dr Hill and Molly today, played hollow knight and beat saber, wrote like 1 line of code and that was about it honestly. I was going to chicken out of quitting LM but I'm going through and making that conversation, talking about hoping I get to write a paper and not being sure what the time commitment would be for phase 2. If they say my contract doesn't allow me and I have to stick it through, then I'll stick it through, lo que sea. Part of me is wondering whether bringing up this discussion is going to cause more issues, the other part knows it'd be good for my peace of mind, but it's also for the law school so like idk, I'm going to sleep on the decision..I'm enjoying the frieren anime

    Entry: Feeling slightly better...again, I'm not going to chicken out of my decision and I need to learn how to do this, i don't want to cheat myself out of peace of mind. ..I played journey today and it was amazing! Finished it, and is visuals and storytelling are top notch, also went on campus for No rEASON cause we didn't have a meeting today which sucks but is what it is. Then watched some star wars, and even though I'm not 100 percent, I'm still feeling better, but I suppose it's time to get off my bum and start getting into stuff, idk if this feeling of drainedness would leave but I can only do what I can. So tomorrow I'm seeing if I can set back up truenas and play around with it, and then also play around with nix, and continue the ml course, along with the networking course, it gives me a plan on what to do rather than dwelling on what I can't do

    Entry: I'm feeling better about things, just slightly, like the more I'm doing things from my normal routine like chatting with Ethan and Andre and like, started playing hollow knight, and had a call with Dan so we'll see how it goes. I have made up my mind to resign from legalmeasure, the contract still hasn't gone through and I don't really care. Right now nothing would make me happier than resigning from it all, so luckily we have our call on Saturday and I'll say it then, ive made up my mind and I think by doing so, I'll regain some peace of mind, as long as I am able to focus on the stuff with Dr Hill and dr Nafea, i should be good..For one thing, thank God Matt didn't push and understood and we were able to converse about Linux later, and thank God for all the opportunities I've gotten and where I am now, I'm feeling much better about it all, and less queasy and I think I'll get better after I wake up, I already did the readings for Dr Nafea and I'll be on campus tomorrow, there I prolly can talk to Dr Hill too. ..Im quitting legalmeasure, feels weird, im having so many new experiences this week. God willing I can laugh at all of this in the future. If you're reading this future ara, hope you can smile at this situation, I hope you have the peace of mind reminiscent of that of nostalgia, and I hope everything has been sorted out...That's all I can hope for. Right now, I'm working on focusing on what I have, and what I can do [what's in my control], and right now, getting rid of LM is in my control so I'll focus on that

    Entry: Many different languages - keyboard acting up again, idk if this has been hacked lol, hello hacker 0-o, but like, he was also like he'd be scared as heck if he had to move back home and that leads me to believe,as well as with his general attitude that he really does see talent in me and wants me on his team which id love, and I know I shouldn't be worrying cause of the Bible and stuff (weakest justification ever), and writing here makes me feel a bit better but I also just kinda wanna scream and like slap myself, and like, the best case scenario happened, he was like okay, but let's keep in touch, which is prolly what he's gonna tell his acct, but that's another thing that worries me, slightly maybe, idk what he'll tell his acct, I don't think it'll be anything horrible, but I can't think about it cause I don't have any control of it, I can only do what I can. but like yeah I can now reach out to dr Hill and let him know I can work for him, and I can do the Karen stuff too,unless I chicken out which now I feel like doing aUAHGAHAGSGS, i just feel bad all around!! SeAHSHUSSGAIABEUEKAOAB ughhhhhhhhHHHHHHhiūü idk if Im screwing future me or if I've already screwed future me and all I can do now is wait, but like, FUUUUUUUUCCKKKKKKKJJ, I wanna swear but I also don't but like, AHHHHhhhGH, now the worries with the Karen stuff is also sinking in and I wanna hit my head on many different walls and I wanna EUFHFUSNFKFUSB I don't wanna spiral and start making unrealistic scenarios in my head but everything just feels so cloudy, this is def the worst I've felt in a while, and there's the whole situation with Ben that's just looking over my head and it's like I wanna, AGAGEEJROTN, AHSUDBSHSBRR. The more I think about this the worse off I am, I'm just gonna, shut it and focus on right now

    Entry: I think things are settling now, I'm still slightly worried and terrified, but rn we are talking about Linux and our projects and stuff and Ethan was right that he does love learning and playing around with stuff, for now we put the internship talk on hold and as of now that seems to be the case, but I'm still now worried about the green card and stuff and how it's all going to go..I still feel terrible ughhhh, like, I knew I was making bad decisions, but like, UGGHH, part of me is also more fearful about like, if my parents are worried now and like, stuff like that, I mean, if I try to gaslight myself into forgetting about it, it could all be a lot worse, I do fear like, my mum being like I told you so and like, why did you let it get this far, and then bringing mr Tosin into it and essentially shooting myself in the foot, like that's my number 2 fear, the number 1 fear is that the accountant wouldn't be able to let it go and they'll be like, on my head and the next thing I know I'm in trouble, but that's highly unlikely, and it's like, idk if I'm convincing myself that its probable, but like, idk idk idk, I'm like worried about it, but it could always be so much worse, like if he was like, well you have to answer the question or else..., then I'd be screwed in so

    Entry: It's happening!..Update, I got his number and we were talking and the likelihood is that it wouldn't go through, which sucks! But we won't want to do anything to forsaken the visa...UGH I FEEL LIKE IM MAKING BAD DECISIONS, ugh I'm quite stressed, he seems like a really nice person, even when talking with him, and I hope and pray everything resolves itself, but rn I have no appetite or desire to do anything, UHH, this is going to be the first awful in a while, part of me feels like throwing up, he seems like he has been making the effort to help, talking to this accountant and stuff, he says he sees the talent in me , part of me is terrified, idk, now all I can do is wait for his accountant??? Or like, idek at this point, I'm very much worrying about it, but I can't just worry, ugh whatever happens happens..Edit cause I don't wanna keep adding bad emotions but I feel like trash, And it's like, I keep thinking of the worst case scenario, sometimes the unrealistic worst case scenario and somehow coerce myself into thinking it's realistic and then it just scares me more because I can't see the positives, And I fear that if I try to start looking on the positive side, then I'll be in a bigger dismay when everything freaking crumbles around me, like I wanna, aUghHHH, I feel like I can't afford myself the convenience of thinking about the best case scenario, I've been queasy for the past hour or two, and I didn't get any work done , I still need to tell my parents I have to go to campus on Thursday, I just feel terrible all around. If I'm going to keep feeling this way, it won't do me any good at all, so, let's focus only, and I mean only on the best case scenario. ..Matt tells his accountant and his accountant tells him that I can't work at all because I'm on F2 till everything gets sorted out, Matt tells me and I'm like, oh bummer, maybe next time, I work for Karen and Dr Hill and dr Nafea, the end, ..AUGHHHHHHHHH, I feel lAAAAA, now I can't even focus on that end cause it feels stupid, and I don't wanna reread my convos with him, AHHHHHH,

I know when I get back to working, I'll be moving back at near 100%, but even rn, as i'm writing this, I'm just growing more and more tired

    Entry: I feel very very conflicted and feel like I'm setting up future me for a lotta pain. Essentially I have the stuff with Dr Hill, the stuff with Karen, the stuff with Dr Nafea, and then there's Solvaris looming in the distance hanging over my head. Like, if I could choose one, I would go for solvaris cause there's just so much I could get out of it, it'd be like, best case scenario, I drop everything else and solvaris figures out the perfect way to pay me with scholarship, but then the most likely outcome is that it's gonna be a constant emailing back and forth and nothing will come out of it except more worrying, some confusion, and maybe some burned bridges which would be terrible...Right now I'm essentially cementing myself into doing the stuff for Dr Nafea, and maybe the stuff for Karen and Dr Hill, and I have to choose between doing all three, or cutting them in hopes that solvaris pulls through, or not even specifically that, it's just that the fact that I dont know where I'll stand with the outcome of solvaris makes everything so uncertain!! I wouldn't like to drop out of what I'm doing with Dr Hill, or with legalmeasure, or with Dr Nafea!! ..Dr Nafea still did give good advice about going into ML becayse even if I don't get a direct job with it, I'm still going to interact with it somehow in the future and knowing all these will be great. Which is why rn I'm more conflicted. ..So far I have ..Dr Nafea - 10 hours a week commitment, go to campus Tuesdays and Thursdays ..Dr Hill - Nothing has been finalized yet but I know the opportunity is there if needed. Moreso, I'll be on campus anyways so I can work on it whenever I'm there..Legalmeasure: I will be working at home and even then, I can still do work on it when I'm in school ..Solvaris: 40 hours a week, 8 hours a day commitment, doesn't leave a lot of time for any of the other ones, provides a lot of opportunities, opportunity to connect to new people, opportunity to work on pretty big stuff...but at the expense of all the other three...Right now I feel like choosing Dr Hill, Dr Nafea, and Legalmeasure will take me down a very different path than if I were to go for Solvaris, like an actual crossroad, but nothing has even being finalized yet with Solvaris and I'm mostly anxiously waiting for him to email me back, and if the result is a negative and I have to do all the tax thing, and I'm able to be like, I'm sorry but thanks for the opportunity, I would be moving down the path of research, which is, if it's something like R and D, I wouldn't mind doing it I believe, but like, either solvaris and get company clout, outdo myself, and so on, or go for writing and reading research papers. I think at this point, I'm still a bit sheltered, till Matt responds, and if his answer is yes, something can be worked out, then I'll have a bigger issue on my hands, ..On the other hands, if he says nothing can be worked out, then I'd be more comfortable going down the second research road, and I even feel more comforted thinking about that because it's like, stable, rigid, in front of me. ..We will see if Matt responds soon, I'm hoping he does so that I can email Dr Hill about setting something up

    Entry: Started trigun, pretty good anime, also I've still been procrastinating on emailing Karen ugh, I promise I'll do it tomorrow!! ALSO, I made apple hand pies!! And apart from the dough slightly, it turned out really well and I'm proud of it xD, it's very sweet tho, I glazed it in its own syrup. It also rained so it's kinda cool which is nice. ..This summer so far is having a different vibe than last, but I think it's just cause I'm taking these first few days to do really no productive work as it relates to coding ( RN I'm having a cross roads about diving into ML but don't know if it's going to hurt me ). Apart from that tho, last summer was more focused on solo, like, me on my own enjoying my time<, and even though this summer has elements of that, and I'm working on learning to do things for myself and not for recognition of doing it or of underlying spite or sth, we also have times where the entire family is at home which got very rare and now it's looking like it's going to be a common theme, and honestly it has its own "nostalgic" feeling ..I did some beat saber for some good cardio and played cards and tankards, my eye is getting better, and whenever I don't pay attention to it I can go for hours without noticing it,..Now I'm quite tired, even though my bedtime has been moving up slowly over the years, I'm glad I'm still with a consistent schedule, I'm also just counting the days or hours till Matt responds and then everything gets derailed and I geg panicky and worried and we might just have to call everything off, fun!

    Entry: Pretty bummy day, which was amazing, I played some beat saber, added toppings on pizza which tasted weird, my eye still weird, but like, only when I notice it if that makes sense, normally id just be fine with it, it's still white and stuff so no irritation, tried washing it out earlier today as well..Watched phantom menace again and I kinda enjoyed it, I've also been wondering whether ml slash ai is worth going into if I'm not looking towards a masters or PhD, and i haven't really made that decision yet, I still have that networking course to finish!!..Also 4.0 SEMESTER WOOO, all As thank God, Andre also passed both classes which is really good, the whole Ben situation is still in The back of my mind, and it's getting me to enjoy talking to Ethan and Andre for the sake of enjoying talking to them, I still feel like he's watching and like not so out of reach but our of grasp if that makes sense, but I'm giving him his space and giving me my space to grow and evolve. Also gotta email Karen and co tomorrow 😭😭..Also played a good amount of chess today, and quite warm weather too, I'm dedicating this summer to working on respiratory health and beat saber is an amazingly effective way to do it

    Entry: The keyboard was acting weird for the other one so I'm just continuing here, as smoothly as I can with ethan or Andre, like even things like joking or being happy for the person now all just seems forced and contrived , which is something I don't want, so I do suppose that I also need this time away from him and just try to start the entire relationship from scratch without the dang malice that comes with it...ON THE OTHER HAND, I FINISHED BALDURS GATE AND ITD SICK, I CHOSE RHE ENDING WHERE I GO TO AVERNUS WITH KARLACH AND WE TRY TO FIX HER, she's definitely top tier , one of my favorite chars. ..Next game is cyberpunk lol, turned in game design today so officially officially done with school and all school related activities, except checking for grades. Tomorrow we call with Dan and I still gotta do the Codey code, also! Uhh, I got a hundy and might blow it all on crab Rangoons tomorrow

    Entry: Technically first day as a free man, and yes I did laze around, its still slowly sinking in that summer has started, ALSO MY DANG EYE STILL HURTS BUT I DONT THINK THERE'S ANYTHING IN IT, it quite annoying 😭, also my mum made me bracelet thingys and even though they're tight, I really wanna keep wearing them xD. ..Oh and idk if I mentioned yesterday but Matt responded with like some tax talk and Mr Tosin and my parents were like nope so let's see if I can get paid without taxes 😭😭😭😭..Hmm, I got a 100.6 on dlc final! And doing really well on the stuff that is being graded so far so we'll see how it all turns out, pretty excitinggggg. Hmm, Ben left the duck server, kinda unprovoked, but there were apparently a lot of things leading up to it, and I can 100 percent see that, our relationship has strained so much and I won't be surprised if we don't talk for the entire summer, honestly I did need a break from him as well but part of me feels like I'd struggle to rekindle the flames after it's all over if that makes sense, like, idk, idk if I'm ready to approach him and look at him in the eye and talk without a bunch a things at the back of my mind for the things that I wanted to say but didn't say and like I feel like I can no longer interact with him as smoothly as I can with ethan or with an

    Entry: I'm not letting my terrible choices stop me from writing here, I feel like I'm falling into temptation just because, like I've lost hope or the discipline to fight it, same with working out, it feels like my discipline is slowly slipping, same with Duolingo and language learning, and kinda same with coding. Maybe it's isolated to these last few days of schooling, tomorrow is literally the last day 😭😭, and we have our dang finals, I gotta email Yvonne about leaving early cause of OS final, game design presentation went really well tho. Christian outdid himself with his project xD which was really cool to see. ..Idk why I'm sleeping with the stuffed animals lol, crap I might still need to tell Dr Hill I can't work with him, so many things are up in the air. That part is making me feel especially nervous, I don't feel like that anymore as it comes to studying cause now I feel more prepared for both classes, I also gotta make the OEE changes and Karen didn't respond which honestly is so fine by me, I really just wanna get paid 😭😭..and now I'm very tired and gonna go head to bed, buenas noches..One thing I really wanna note is that my parents relationship has gotten so so much better, and it's something that I've been noticing more and more, it's really nice to see lol, but also makes me scared, cause like if something happens to one of them, God forbid, then idek how I would react, it keeps me thankful of our current situation, but still it's like, geez, the future can being anything

    Entry: Yo boy has been studying!! Worked on discrete watching the lecture vids to make sure I'm caught up, and essentially finished with game design woo! And now just gotta make my PowerPoint presentation and turn it all in ( gonna do all that tomorrow, honestly still not done studying for DS ), so I am ever so slightly worried about being able to do all of it, and one thing will have to suffer, but it's more like a slight issue, it's not causing real stress. Weve gotten great grades for our dlc projects cause honestly she's grading so amazingly lightly thank God. I'm gonna be helping Richard at yte on Saturday so I don't get to fully relax yet. ..Tomorrow we study for OS, finish DS and turn in game design, I can do this 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤, with the help of God of course. That's essentially all I did today, along with playing shadow fight 🥹🥹..UDm posted me lifting and I had my feet out loll. Concerning how I feel, I felt very productive today, and just like, focused all day, which is honesty a dang lie cause I was playing shadow fight for half of the time i was watching his videos , but I do feel accomplished, reviewed a lot of content and even helped Ethan..My parents are talking to each other lol and they're giving Linda x Bob vibes. I had a dream today where I was eating tamales and I could bend and I had long hair and I was in Nigeria and I vaguely remember a farm and it felt like a glimpse into another weird reality xD with a lot of the things on my mind being made there..Tomorrow I start with game design presentations, finish it all and turn it in, then finish studying for DS, essentially gonna go over the graph theory stuff and theory of computation, then end the day with OS, sounds like a plan! Karen hasn't responded to me yet, and I'm so ready to be done with the semester and for Matt to respond to me 🥹🥹

    Entry: I feel like those three pictures perfectly summarize my day. Uninstalled Reddit cause it wasn't good for me, at all, dlc final went okay thank God, workout was cool, chilled outside after studying ds in the spot Ethan and I found and it was honestly really nice. The moon was also super big and like, cartoon like tonight which was amazing. I listened to an ologies podcast about pigeons while working out and I talked to alegs about Kafka and metamorphosis, bringing back flashbacks 😭😭 and I don't have to be on campus tomorrow so I'm just gonna stay home and work on game design x study for ds and os. ..Also had a Cru eboard meeting which went pretty nice, I should stop recapping my day and just like, say how I feel, well I could do both tbh, I feel trashy and tired cause I just ykw and I'm already tired and disappointed in myself now and today was great already, I felt like a ghost for a while in dlc but I got to eat lunch by myself! In peace!!! Which was nice, like chilling outside on the couch, and then chilling inside was very nice. I think I just ended the day on a low note. Anyways happy new day!

    Entry: Pretty good day tbh, TDR had a late night munchies thing and I ate a good amount. One thing I didn't mention before but had crossed my mind is that I haven't thought about savvy and honey badger or giraffe in a long time, even though I did text giraffe! Still tho, it's like,  I've finally moved on xD, well, I moved on a good while ago but still, you get what I mean...I got my DS grade back and got a low A on the counting quiz retake which Im not mad with, he was very very lenient with the grading , I've also been studying for dlc a good amount but I still don't know if I'm over studying or understudying. At this point my efforts could be put towards other things, like trying not to get angry at Ben for not pulling his weight when it comes to the dlc project, I know he just used gpt to generate the code and I'm still  quite miffed about it, but not thinking too hard or much about it and just doing what I can, it's a pretty fun project all things considered. ..I gotta buckle up for OS, and DS honestly there is a ton to study, good thing I don't have to come on campus one Wednesday WOOP WOOP, gonna start going over those after dlc exam...Hmm what else what else, gonna start combing hair a lot more so it doesn't get tangled, we are on our way home rn and tbh it is pretty late..Also Ethan was talking to me about Titus and like, Titus being very anti liberal, it's the strangest thing, and I thought I had gotten to know him, but like, even now it is kinda baffling, I never really saw him in that light, but yeah I'm not losing sleep over it. Hmmm tonight what do I do, I could either keep studying for dlc, pivot and study for sth else, relax, which doesn't sound half bad, work on LM, hm if I havent made a choice I'll just roll a d3

    Entry: Honestly today has all the makings of a great day, first things first, MAN BUN SUPREMACY, my mum and Eyitooni helped me pack and detangle my hair and I'm digging the man bun 😔, at least it's a good method for stretching out my hair too and not letting it get tangled while I sleep, kinda a win win, im also hoping it stretches out my hair so that Id get even longer hair or sth idk, ..Also, no meeting with Karen, yassss, she forgot but I think she didn't, idek I'm just happy it didn't happen. Studied a lot for dlc and feeling super confident except for a few things imma ask him tomorrow. Apart from that I made great progress on my game design final project and im really liking how it turned out, watched some Spanish shows..Alsogot on a call with Andre for dlc, pretty productive day honestly, even worked on LM and learned some more about the mongoose x mongo syntax, there's still a lot I don't know, but I'm learning!

For the good news tho, matt got back to me and Im he suggested using a scholarship program to pay me and it just could work which would be pretty sick but now I would have to turn down Dr Hill 😔😔😭, and I was slightly starting to look forward to it. Idk tho, it's still up in the air and I don't want to jump to conclusions, I played baldurs gate for way too long today too :*)

    Entry: Prolly one of my earliest entries but I'm going through that period again where I'm like, is web development really want I want to do? Like does it make any meaningful difference, if not web dev, what even would I do. Ughhh I guess I'm still young so I still have time to decide and time over the summer to find out what would work for me, but like, dang, if I don't address it, I'd probably start to feel very very lost. I mean, I think backend stuff is cool and all, hmmmmm, ugh

    Entry: Alright I did feel quite productive, did work on DLC and I did enjoy it a good amount, it felt like I was being creative, and now for the TERRIBLE PART. IT SEEMS KIKE MATT DJDNT SEE MY PREVIOUS EMAIL DENYING OR TURNINF DOWN THE OFFER AND NOW I HAVS TO TELL IT TO HIM, UGHHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHH I WANNA JUMP 😭😭😭😭, and even worse that he might've fired Ethan because of me, and now I have to turn it down FRICKKKK. I gotta email him tonight, first thing I'm doing when I get home, i wanna 😭😭😭, oml, at least it shows me that some of my previous brain thought processes as to why he wasn't responding was a good leap. ..I also did face some envy/jealousy today but i was able to overcome it fairly quickly tbh, sometimes in the process I do feel like time passes by slowly lol but in the grand scheme of things, I think I'm still getting better at dealing with it, thank God? Oh crap I gotta help josephene, I'mma put a reminder on my phone 😭😭

    Entry: Today was chill, except I've been feeling very overwhelmed about the approaching finals! Cause there is a lot for me to study and catch up on and I feel like I'm falling behind in dlc, os and discrete, which is then made worse by me not really feeling up to doing any work. It's like pre burn out. I'd be in the library and my brain just isn't clicking to do any work, I have barely gotten much done for legalmeasure and I hope we postpone the meeting if possible, and we gotta do dlc final project tomorrow, ..Today was destress fest too but there were too many people so I didn't really do anything, just got a penguin!! Then walked out. I was still able to get a chunk of the leadership evaluations and stuff done, as well as a draft on the final paper. For dlc I did the extra credit I think assignment with the tape thingy, I'll focus on studying for dlc tomorrow..Also Dr Hill talked to me about continuing stuff for the summer and somehow he knew what I was doing for the law school AND Dr Nafea which is insane 😭😭, I wonder how many levers he's pulling in the background, but he asked about the potential of me continuing with it to make a publication which honestly I think would be sick, then I brought the idea of upgrading all the software and he was like we could do it and maybe hire someone under me that'll handle all the setup and stuff which would be sick!! I'd be leading my first team loll. Nothing is finalized yet so we'll see, but I'm kinda excited about the possibility to go on campus over the summer but only on some days!! And when I feel like it, but we'll see! I wouldn't want to be on campus everyday for sure but if a quiet new scenery presents itself I won't say no!..Hopefully my summers not too packed doing all that stuff, meh I think we should be fine. Just gotta get LM deployed by Sunday and hopefully it goes well, I pray it goes well. That was kinda the highlight of my day, and watching From, I just haven't felt motivated to work much, but I do still have times where I just work without thinking about doing or dreading the work which is nice. Mainly I'm just overwhelmed about catching up with the work so I'm working on DS tomorrow, mañana, we catch up!!! For DS, I got enough time

    Entry: Number 1, From is an amazing show, number 2, project management presentation went swimmingly!! It was even fun honestly, he said we were the best group so far. ALSO! I got a 52/53 on the dlc exam, which, yass!!! Thank God at least cause I def didn't do that on my own. ..I did some jump roping after my workout and my shins HURTTY, also I woke up to a scream but it was all in my head and apparently it's a thing called exploding head syndrome. At least they're temporary and normal. Just looked it up and apparently they'd grow back stronger, the more you know. ..I also found out Dr Qian teaches developmental psychology and she talked about me in the intro video, it was cool. Also Joe invited me to watch small people wrestle in June, and i might go 😂, it's some Mexican tradition and sounds really fun, there's gonna be a lotta tacos...Summer break is almost here!! And i.prolly should be headed to sleep, yeah imma go bed. Buenas noches..AND NOW ITS RAINING

    Entry: Journaling earlier today really helped me refocus/recenter, but again, the relationship is still strained and over the summer, I guess I won't be looking forward to working with him, but I'm coming to the realization/technically already did come to the realization that working together did neither of us any good and it just messes up the friendship, and I don't like having strained strange awkward relationships! So yeah, I think as far as I see it, this will be the last project we are working together on, at least barring the summer one, but we'll see how it goes. I'm hoping to work with Ethan for senior design and I feel like I might be being too hasty in that decision, especially since anything can happen, but it doesn't stop my from making the decision now and working towards it, and I'll pivot it push comes to shove...In terms of today, it was pretty good, woke up too early then slept for an hour ish. Worked mainly on project management slides - the cause of my argument and worked up feelings, then went to campus, chilled in Andres dorm for i think the first time in the semester with josephene and Ethan and I did enjoy myself, we then went to TDR, lukases friends make me very uncomfortable and I feel awkward when even around them, feels like I get cat called lol, as of now they only know me for my brother and my muscles, and I guess I'm fine with that if I'm not gonna be seeing them, essentially ever? Or at least very very scarcely ..Hmm, oh oh then I accepted Andy's invite to dinner! But it wasn't at his house, we went to a place called papas drive through and got some food, I got a chicken pita which was good, and we ate outside at a park. I was so worried his car would get stolen and then I'd have to explain where I was and it'd be a whole deal. Well thank God his car didn't get stolen xD. ..It's essentially gonna be the last time I'll be off campus prolly, which I suppose is fine. Maybe with Ethan next?..Then I worked out, jumping ropes are no joke! But I had fun and got better at doing the fast ones, it's amazing cardio and Im enjoying doing it with music , did it for 30 ish minutes today, def focusing more on it that with cardio, then we did dlc and turned it in, life's good, about to go to sleep, it's still pretty warm but getting fairly cold at night. Also, bedbugs! Yay 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨..Tomorrow I'll work more on game design

    Entry: These are the last projects Im working on with Ben, it's not good for our friendship and it's not good for my state of being, I found out he got gpt 4 ad now the dlc final being done makes a lot more sense now and I'm getting worked up over it but I'm writing it here to calm down.i was gonna ask Ethan for his conflict management tips but I don't want to bring him into this, doesn't feel genuine , I'm re reading over and its getting me more worked up ....I just did a lil prayer and honestly it helped, kinda a lot , to refocus myself at least, seeing that this is a minor issue and doesn't do anything to glorify God but just causes resentment (big word, but the sentiment is there), annoyance , frustration and messed up relationships. I'll work on not fanning the flames when I see him, keeping a calm head. If I always keep in mind that I should love everyone, even if I feel wronged, one is that I should turn the other cheek and forgive, and the other is to keep the love going. ..This was very productive, I'm pretty calm now, gotta keep the deep breaths, I'm not the biggest fan of conflicts, but now that I am in one and can't avoid it, I have to be able to resolve it in the most Godly way possible

    Entry: Honestly I feel great just because of the weather. I'm getting the *summer emotions* already and we still got 2 weeks left! I also had a call with Karen and John that lasted Ab HOUR 30 MINS but I think Karen liked it and we are almost there!!! ALMOST!! ..Also made pizza that tasted really good! My mum went to work and I did bum around for a while, but I studied a bit for operating systems quiz tomorrow, and worked a teensy bit on game design, it's barely coherent but it's something at least, it's also getting super late and I should stop sleeping near 12 😓..Ben and Andre are in the chat ranting about classes and at this point, there is some tension building up as it relates to things I wanna say, but I don't have the power nor do I want the drama, we have two weeks left and I just wanna get it done ✨. I also played way too much shadowfight today lol. Anyways tomorrow is a new day! I haven't said this in a long time but take things one step at a time and you'll find your way ..Also, I don't think I. Talked about the powerlifting comp!! I got 1105lbs total but failed on squats and bench which was humbling, but it showed me what I need to work towards, which is always great! ..Loll course evaluations are out already. Crap, I'm going to be a senior soon, then I'll be graduating. Inhaleeee, i will not pre worry, gonna tackle things one thing at a time and enjoy them as they come. Also I don't think I talked about the seed potluck with Dr Hill and Chris being the chef and it was quite smokey lol. A random thing, Chris left me to turn on one of those burner thingys cause she trusted me more than most people there which boosted my ego, or at least sense of self worth a good amount, at the detriment of others I guess ;-;..I'm much less sore now thank God, reverting back to my previous strength. The summer emotions are hitting hard!! Even the sound of the fan is flipping nostalgic, I'll let you know when it wears off lol but I feel like I'm entering another arc of my life ..I also watched a bunch a neon Evangelion

I was watching UFC 300 with pigeon and I really enjoyed it, maybe more than I'd like to admit, I've also been texting Jared more! Did some game design and turned in leadership and OS but not a ton of progress tbh, dlc is just there. Karen emailed me back and I think we meet tomorrow, I wanna say blech..blech, I'm not feeling like it tbh, we have two weeks left in the semester! ..I'm suler tired and still super sore.

Mistakenly dropped my brothers chain down the sink 😭😭, I feel terrible about it but didn't admit to it cause idk 🥺🥺, fear of consequences yay ;-;. ..Then I didn't go to slide rule and found out later that I got an award 😭😭😭, I'm like, my reaction to most things now is just embarrassment 😭😭, I did do some work on dlc and spent most of the day along so that's pretty nice..Finallllyyy responded to Dr bani Taan and emailed Karen, now I have a semi headache and gotta do some more game design, tomorrow I'll clean things up eugh, at least after I ask Prof rice a question, might as well keep moving forward ..Also met with Molly, and saw her yesterday!!!

I worked a bunch on game design and sky launched on PC!! Dude we have 2 weeks left, dead week then finals, we almost made it brah

Gotta practice more. Ugh it smells weird here, there hasn't been any talk of moving out :*), which yeah sucks, I really do wish we could've gotten out of here as soon as my dad got his job but I guess the smarter thing to do is to be smart with money especially in an already established area, and even if it gets progressively worse, ugh I do have to be thankful, ..Which brings me back to me making a series of bad decisions and now we have to start from square 1 :"). .. moving away from that, leadership class was outside today, I really really want to say that im getting better at regulating my emotions in terms of envy but idk if I'd be lying 😕, i haven't been blatantly faced with a situation like with semilogo and the debate, FUNNILY ENOUGH, this morning i was trying to remember how to pronounce his name lol ..Sky comes out on PC tomorrow! But Im gonna be focusing on partly game design to start, I'll God willing finish the second level, it's somlatez I gotta head to bed, hasta luego

    Entry: Not as insanely. Productive as I would've liked but that's alright , I think the biggest disappointment was in game design, I made pretty much no progress :(. I did study for dlc and that just showed me.how much more I need to know, and I did operating systems but I haven't been able to get fork working, I'm so flipping close , with a stroke of luck I was able to get exec done, thank God. ..I was also able to get my leadership paper in today, and worked on the notification feature for LM, which mantas came in clutchhhh and helped me find a way of implementation, the cron job runs every 10 mins when the server is up, queries the DB to see whether there's any template that the user should be notified of and whether the notification time has passed, and if it has, it'll reset the field. It works really well and I'm happy with it. Even ended the day strong by working on the get orders page and cleaning up the get purchased templates functionality, which is greatttt. Essentially now every page is there, also thank God Karen didn't respond so no meeting over the weekend woo!..Tomorrow should be a pretty chill day, I can fit in some good work, and studying for DLC mainly too. In terms of LM, wow it's late, I still have some polishing to do here and there. Nothing super major and I think I can start looking into deployment stuff, but I'm happy with how big the site has grown, it's my most complicated project to date!..Also finished ninja kamui and land of the lustrous, land of the lustrous was up here

    Entry: Fairly straightforward day, I made some great progress actually on my game design and I'm like thinking back into it and excited to work more on it, I think it's going to turn out well, I'm already thinking of more ideas for it even. Did a bit of OEE and it was aight I suppose, gotta make some changes tho. Thank God Karen didn't message me today, we might have our meeting tomorrow, im kinda overwhelmed thinking about how I'd set up a notification system. I think ill jus go a very basic route and try to piece stuff together before 12. Then I gotta keep studying for digital logic. I already didsome today so I'm feeling a lot more confident about things like karnaugh maps and minterms ..Ended the day playing baldurs gate which was cool. Tomorrow we study!!

    Entry: Today was chill, project management exam was quite ez! ..Hmm, Karen wants to set up a meeting for the weekend and I'm trying to get the changes done before them, God willing by tomorrow, yo today was so weird, well it started out weird, I spent some time sleeping on the couch??! Idek why, idek how I got there, idk how early it was but I was there xD...Today was quite busy honestly, mostly because of LM and a general sense of, wow I have a good amount of free time. Essentially did get the user account features going, changed how things are setup so cart and stuff related to it are broken 😭😭, didn't even get to look into deployment services yet. So I just worked on all the admin facing stuff and as of now, I think I'm in a good place for admin stuff, now just gotta translate it over to the user stuff and we'll see how that goes. Still gotta do the dang notifications. Meh I don't have to do it all this week, I'll be fine. As long as I fix the document versioning and cart. I even got some new cool UI going on and it works pretty well now! I'm having that thing where I overthink how something got implemented so thats how I know I'm on the right path ..Oh the powerlifting thingy was today and I chatted with Titus for a bit. For the competition next week, I might not go all out, part of me is scared of injury which i suppose is reasonable, we'll see tho..I've been watching so many short films on YouTube and they are like, they make me feel strange, there are specific ones at least that have that reaction, ..Anyways it's very late and I woke up very tired this morning 🥲, buona notte..Also StepUp last day was today WOOOOOOO HECK YEAH

    Entry: I'm feeling semi conflicted, but it's nothing important and as I continue to grow in character and in my faith, it's something I'm getting better at. Even if sometimes I still dwell on things - essentially the thing I turned down Richard on, my brother hadn't and he got selected , and it's in Cali, so like, I'm handling it well, I'd say I've grown, BUT NOT IN ALL AREAS, I'm still a mess honestly, I gotta tone down my ego a bunch, like a whole bunch yeesh, humility, like actual humility, not forced hunility is def something to work on..Saying that, how to actually work on it, I have no idea, maybe constantly exposing myself to situations where I get humbled, like this one maybe, I'm, fine with that, in theory xD..Anyways I'm pretty tired, Andre is about to submit the project management spmp..I'm really looking forward to the summer. And Wednesday night Cru was amazing ,we had macarons!

    Entry: Dang I want to cry, I kinda am crying a little lol,  God is amazing, I sent Dr Nafea a response email, and Ik I didn't finish my last entry, but I was very conflicted and saddened and worried about everything, prayed a bit, jumped jacks a bit, then sent Dr Nafea an email. ..I explained that I can't work as of now, and he just responded first thanking me for explaining my situation, then telling me that the financial aid office will work everything out and he just needs to fill out paperwork, and that's alright. I'm so freaking relieved. I wish I could like, wow idk, wow, lol I have so much gratitude and idk how to express it...It's like, a jumble of feelings, gratitude, caution, still a tiny bit of worry, uncertainty, what if he asks for more information that I can't provide, etc etc. but I'm leaving it all in God's hands. Its like a weight was lifted off my shoulders and I'm still immensely grateful, I'll have to make sure to do my hardest and best over the summer lol. I'll talk later..Edit (much later in the day)..I'm still so grateful and thankful it's amazing. I send Karen an email answering her questions and asking some more questions. We are almost there brah. Project management was supposed to be due tonivhf but he made if for tomorrow. We had the mock exam and students were able to choose if they wanted that as their exam which is crazy 🥹...I'm looking into jumprooing as my main source of cardio, kinda weird ending to today lol,this has been an emotionally charged and taxing day

    Entry: Okay back to discussing my discussion with Dr nafea. Honestly AI research doesn't interest me, or not exactly that, because it's interesting and mysterious, but the idea of reading research papers and complex mathematics as of now does not tickle my bacon as much as working on solvaris and an admin dashboard does (example). ..But it does expose me to different fields and if possible, I see a potential in me really enjoying it and then being able to use AI for good in the world, so I'm not turning it down at all. I also asked them for advise about generalizing and stuff and dr bani Taan was like I'm still young and I should try to learn as much stuff as possible, which is GREATT advice honestly. It's another thing that I had forgotten, or at least inadvertently dismissed, there's still a world of learning that I could take part of and I might be selling myself.short staying in my.comfort zone all the time. These two opportunities will help me get out of my comfort zone, which is amazing! And from there even more growth will happen. I'm feeling better in terms of my cold, God willing it's essentially gone tomorrow...Andy brought some soup for me and it was really good. I'm also looking to get into jumping jacks! Mostly as a form of cardio, like a beat saber alternative, and then I'm still gonna be focusing on lower than upper, so I don't know if I should change my program since it's so upper focused, and just make my own exercises that I feel are best for me. I'm still doing like hypertrophy training but varied rep ranges so I'm also growing stronger, but so idk If I should just bite the bullet and make my own program or find one online. I had done like 25 mins walking and 5 mins jumping jacks, but I wanna be more consistent with jumping jacks, so we will see. It's something I'm really looking forward to, and being able to groove with the rope..I'm quite pooped tho, I'm thinking of revamping my game idea to go back to basics and do the Pac-Man idea...We'll see... ..Oh oh I made some really good progress on LM today and now I think I have all the base functionality done! Famous last words

    Entry: God works in mysterious ways, I finally sucked.it up and sent an email to Matt rejecting his summer internship opportunity, then Dr bani Taan emailed me about. Meeting in his officefor a summer opportunity, which I said yes to ofc. Then Dr nafea saw me and was also looking into joining the meeting to get to know me more, so we talked for a while and he kinda gave advice about generalizing vs specializing and it was nice...It's an ai opportunity and at least it would give me the chance.to do something different, my phone screen is being dumb rn but I'll fully analyze.the convo later. Peace

    Entry: Both parents went to work today and I forgot it was Easter! So happy easter, spent a good chunk of the day watching shows like legion and solo leveling, and working on LM, which i didn't think I was making good progress on but now i think I am, barring any big changes😭..I'm still feeling under the weather, it is what it is, it gave today a nice vibe tho, it was different from other days. I even played baldurs gate for a good bit, and worked minimally on project management..Played a lot of shadow fight tho, a LOT. Just to pass the time. .I am going to send the email to Matt tomorrow, Matt lauer for future me, first thing I'm doing tomorrow, I've made up my mind! And I told my mum already if I didn't tell you yet. ..I'm also starting my lower body and cardio arc, wish me luck!

    Entry: Being sick suckssssss, my nose is more.blocked now and my jaw is tight 😭😭, I got some project management work done tho, and reached 70 pages woo! I think. Also did dlc quiz and got 12/12 and it was cool, even played a bit of VR today. ..I am very thankful to pise tho, he brought me back to my roots of learning Ina. Way that I had forgotten how to! I learned about aggregations with MongoDB because I was looking up ways to solve a problem and did solve it, even though without aggregations, still an amazing learning moment

    Entry: Feeling a bit sick, no school today so stayed home all day! Twas nice but I was still busy, but was still nice, specifically spent the better part of the day doing game design and project management, got some lm done tho, and even a teensy bit of oee, LM is getting more and more fleshed out which I'm enjoying, and pise is motivating me to go back to my roots of continuously learning, like, reading articles when I come across a problem and letting myself go down a rabbit hole of learning! Like me learning about multiple uses for template tags today!! A lotta times nowadays it's just chat gpt offering the suggestions to me vut I think I'll go back to using it as a final attempt when stuck or at least when doing things I don't really care about or are trivial...Random thing, I tried gel on my hair and it did some good things for the curls, they're pretty defined, and hard xD , but it worked! ..We got approved for the eit conference, I think, and I still gotta tell my parents about FREAKICNG SOLVARIS AAAHHHHHH, I haven't felt like this in so long. I'll. Do it tomorrow, I must do it tomorrow, literally no choice ..It like couldn't be easier, one of my friends relatives offered me a job over the summer, bada bing vada boom. I'll do that, watch me!! ..Also highlight of my day, apart from making it through it ofc, and making some mid mash potato and buttery lumpy gravy is that I tried out sky's season of nesting and I love it, sky always does make me feel really nice, sometimes lonely of course, but then I don't try to find new friends so I do it to myself :*). I might try to change that..Oh dang it's getting late, I gotta head out, my nose and sinuses are stuffy which sucks, but it's manageable, I can breathe. Also the three body problem is an amazing show, well, it's a great show!..Also sent a message to David, David troupe! Seems like he might not be doing well tho :*)

    Entry: Prayer as a goal was a great addition. I am very much tired, talked with alegs for a while, I have been talking to pise a lot and I really enjoy all their company, also made good progress on document versioning. NO CLASSRS TOMORROW HOOOYAAA, that has been stuck in my head😂, so I'm gonna fully try to get it done. Also, 325!!!!! For 1 on bench is still hypeeee..I played sky for a while and its honestly still beautiful and I had some nice interactions with strangers xD. ..Tomorrow, gonna try to get good work done on game design, luckily mentorship meeting was moved to next week woo! Gotta do some studying for dlc too, then gonna try to clean up and beautiful template features, Karen is gonna answer me by Saturday latest, which she took longer lol, and then yeah, we'll see ..Still haven't told my parents about solvaris loll :*)

    Entry: I' have been SLACKING and just giving in weakly to the temptations and it sucks but it doesn't feel like it sucks, which sucks even more. I've added pray as a goal and I hope to make it a consistent habit, at least more consistent than what I have rn. ..I got some good progress on LM and was able to get some template versioning system blueprint going, tomorrow gonna try to finish it so wish me luck, I got some questions for Karen and John too. The site is coming together really nicely...Tomorrow is powerlifting day and it's something I've been looking forward to all week, which is honestly really nice cause it gets hard to find things to look forward to or hope for, even if, honestly there is so much to, and I think I do hope for little things like eating bread with PB and tea, or using my laptop and watching shows - like 3 body problem which pise recommended and its sick!! I'm really gonna enjoy it. Things like that tho,I guess since the powerlifting is much more of a deviation from my schedule, it stands out as something to look forward to, which honestly is still really nice in its own right ..My dad went to his workplace I believe and got immunizations, and said the paper work is in progress, which means I most likely won't be able to work for solvaris which sucks but it is what it is I guess. It is what it is, not gonna think too hard about it!! I'm honestly really thankful to God for how much good is happening this year and the year is just starting even though it's somehow almost April, each day just flies by and at least I can use this journal to remember and maybe immortalize those days, idk tho, I'm being sentimental...Speaking of which,not really, but, today is Dr dasgupta birthday and we had the test and it was terrrrrrible but now it's out of sight out of mind, and life moves on so all we move on!..Anyways tho, if I can finish document versioning tomorrow, that's the biggest next step! Then maybe over the summer, I can even ask Dr mina about working on the reimbursement project. And that reminds me I gotta do Oee tomorrow. I'll set a reminder and head to bed, buenas noches

But like, now I'm gonna hope that everything is settled by the summer! ..I'm really tired tho, very tired, people are difficult and annoying, I'm not really doing any work rn, im just being a bum about to go to bed, im semi helping josephene debug ..Also the meeting with Ethan's boss went really well, he's really cool, but yeah, so, like, maybe job? Strained relationship, tired, for a 10 on my game design assignment tho and an A in the os quiz but not confident about the test tho

But yeah I was able to get os quiz done, ds quiz turned in, game design FINISHED WOOP WOOOp, took longer than I expected but I did it! Thank God, and then even got some work on LM by working on the cart features, so now I just need to make the user able to purchase multiple documents and we'll be chilling! I'll also need to look into deploying stuff. ..Then, maybe tomorrow I'll focus on it,I was also able to do a tiny bit of project management and even played baldurs gate for a while, pretty productive day honestly. I killed minsc and boo in BG3 😔😔, I think the game is wrapping up now, I just need to find shadows parents andoskar and the steel watchers, dang I kinda do have a lot. ..Anyways off to bed for me. Tomorrow I'll try to finish all the cart features, specifically just payment needs finishing, there's a ton of polishing that needs to go on tho but we should be fine..Oh I also started solo levelling! And I reminisced a bit with world triggers

Was able to get some of my tasks to do done tho, dlc quiz was chill, I got a 15/16 which I'm fine with, then did DS quiz and went on a call with Ben to talk about it and we worked through them, ..Also had a moment of prestress about aging, and like waking up to being 20, and then 30, and then 40 and feeling like I've wasted a good chunk of my life which would suck, I wonder if 20 year old me would get the chance to read this God willing, you best still be working out and maintaining healthy relationships and not being sad and junk, I wonder how different I'll be, crap I wonder if I'll even be. ..I really shouldn't be thinking like this at night lol, I'm gonna go read ma bible cause I have been slacking!!!!!

    Entry: Honestly today was great. We had the powerlifting class which was amazing, Titus is HELLA STRONG, doing 340 for 3, what the heck!! Margo is as strong as ever...I was able to do 4 sets of 315 after 2 sets that started out well but I stopped cause of slippery feet. The machines there are so much better and I love the vibes. There's so much space too, it's insane. I feel like today was a good combo of different parts of me developing, well not really spiritual, there's physical and there's career wise, I'll talk about all that ..But yeah for physical, I met the coach who's name I can't remember dang it, but he's cool and showed me some mobility exercises. Noble and Brandon were also there, I def have a weird relationship with brandon, and maybe both of them now, I notice, and this most likely definitely isn't my place to say, but twinges of jealousy, which I can't say I don't relate to or experience, when he sees others doing bigger lifts and getting more attention, but like, yeah I'm not judging him for it and I can also now recognize it in myself when I'm doing that, RN I'm just looking forward to showing off my bench 😭..Idk where my deadlift stands xD. I was gonna mention something else about physical eee..That's fine, moving to career wise, ethan was working on the software with his, something, and recommended me! And spoke very highly of me 😭😭, then the dude emailed me about the possibility of a summer internship!!!..Which I do hope things are settled before then, but even so, I'd still work for free cause their client is FREAKING TWILIO...Anyways tho, I've been studying for DS quiz, and right now I'm not ultra confident, I go through pulses, OH..I did the presentation for Dr mina 😂, pulses reminded me of clocks and flip flops which Dr Paulik taught me of in office hours..I didn't get to work on LM at all today but I will tomorrow and over the weekend..Also there was an ant twerking and cleaning itself loll. Imma head to bed now

There's some reworking I need to do but nothing extreme, I'm like, halfway there honestly, a good week or two of work, a week of cleanup and finetunes and another week of perfecting and phase 1 would be bing bang done. ..Hopefully not famous last words, but I'm already forgetting how I Implemented some stuff lol, nothing I can't work my way back to tho..Cru went well, we had some good discussions and laughter, also Karen ended the call by saying she'd take me to coffee once we are done 😂. I am worried about how to divert my time with so many busy classes though and I already feel like I'm behind on some of them and ik spending more time on this will keep me busier, but like, I think so far I've been able to push along, I'll survive, just gotta get to summer

But next sem looks like it's gonna be torture. Planning on getting a car by then tho. Also really looking forward to the summer even though I feel like I probably shouldn't. ..I also did some studying for discrete structures and I think I'm catching up but I still gotta practice ;-;

First time in 2024! And I wasn't half bad at all, just one close one with almost hitting the curb lol, but it went smoothly, I won't mind doing it again.

Went to campus to work on dlc and it was pretty nice, also worked on LM a teensy bit, and did I say I saw DR OLLA and Myriam I think her name was, was not expecting her AT ALL. ..The event went well tho, Kevon Butler said I should hit him up anytime I need help with investing and money stuff, I saw jas again and her eyes are so light, also saw lyrik and this dude that paints.and this other Jamaican dude that thought I was Asian. Apparently we get paid,  sickk..Also I think I mentioned my dream earlier, but like, the feeling of isolation from being in prison, I feel like I'll forget the emotion but I don't wanna forget that I experienced it. It was so strange feeling that I'll never be Able to leave the confines of a place...I also somehow remember the taste of the lotion in my mouth. That's enough for today tho. The session for journi went well. Tomorrow we focus on DLC and it's Andres birthday so he's not doing any work

It was so strange like the room was smalls and I was still enjoying the experience, then it hit me that my freedom is gone, I'll have to be in the small room for a long time, and this sergeant dude came in as we were watching psych or sth along those lines and did a tooth inspection, then we started rushing this cteam on our tongue but it turned out to be body cream ..Then my next dream was me and my younger brother playing sky, we had to come up with an idea but we just ended up running around sky in first person pov fixing stuff

Wow I'm very tired I'm headed to bed. ..ALSO 405 DEADLIFT!!! I FEEL SO, different. Like weird 😂, I wanted to go for a 315 bench but the bench was being used, well, the incline was being used. So I was like, might as well deadlift. Everything was looking good and I was able to get 405 for 1!! Radical! I feel like I could've even gotten more but sometimes the mental holds my physical back ..I turned in game design, os and dlc homework and even had a meeting with Dan and I got a bunch a the OEE stuff working. I'm just ready to get to the point tomorrow where I can just relax and chill. Today was very productive tho;

Essentially started off today working on OEE, getting the styling changes mostly, I'm not actually sure what else I had worked on, dang it.im falling behind in discrete structures and it's irking me, I'm gonna have 4 hours.less time to myself over the weekend but it should still be enough time to catch up on most things. ..From the OEE, I went to school, it was Pauliks birthday and pi day, so funn. Andres.birthdsy is on Sunday too and Andrews birthday is next week Tues. I mistakenly wished Andrew a happy birthday instead of Paulik loll ..Anyways from dlc class, with more system verilog, I went to work on the dlc homework, then practice for project management, then project management presentation practice, then the actual presentation which went decent, Andres screen was very reflective so we could see him looking up stuff and it was hilariousss. Even Dr Daimi noticed ..Then I hopped over to the leadership presentation where we set things up and then did our presentation, which thank God went well. ..Today was very jump aroundy, but after proj man, had lunch with andre and Jos, then went back to lab to work on my.sim.assignment, I'm really enjoying system verilog, it's beginning to make more and more sense..THEN went home and had a call with Dan and worked on some more OEE. Then Dr mina emailed about writing her a letter and I dropped everything to write her one I hope she gets the award. ...Anyways, it's late and I'm def gonna struggle waking up 😭, tomorrow I wanna first write my leadership step up session reflections, then finish and turn in game design, then finish oee, all before I leave for school. Then have discrete. Finish sim assignment, badabing, badaboom. We still have sim assignment 6 which we haven't even started, and the others have OS, so funn

I also emailed Karen and John about my progress and made some even more progress, did some work on Oee and it's coming together, and I've started using the elevate app to improve my vocabulary and stuff ..Hansel I and alegs now have a new group chat and they chatt so dang much xD. Maybe it's making me realize just how much busier I am compared to in the past. ..The weather is hot! And I went outside in a normal T-shirt and Irene commented on my muscles 🥹, we also chatted for a while. ..I watched some Bob's burgers, pretty chill day tbh, there are ants now which are kinda annoying, but I did get to finish my meal - Chinese food - from yday, crab Rangoons are still the bomb! ..I'm pretty tired now tho so I'll cya later

Richard already sent the details and wow it's in 4 days already 0-o, ..I essnetily finished the OS assignment, which is sick, it was interesting but I'm not as proud of it as I'd normally would be cause I didn't do the tokenizing myself but I did do a good amount of thinking go get it to work. ..Also made more progress on LM and all the base user account functionality are done. Tomorrow afternoon I'm emailing Karen and John with my progress and questions. ..Dang it I gotta replay to Jeff, my leadership mentor. Also workout today was meh, I gotta switch it up cause i feel like it's too much for me. Had a meeting with Andy and we talked about relatkonships and it was chill. .That madr me realize that I forgot j had the Bucharest from Cru still in my bad, dang it it might've gone bad and now I don't think I should eat it 😭😭,  can't be taking risks ..Anyways tho, tomorrow we work on oee, reading for discrete, we got some digital logic assignment.Oh I also started psychopass s2 and I'm already really enjoying it.

    Entry: I'm kinda chilling, my balls aren't hurting, as much, but the general area around it is, but like, it feels like I haven't popped a joint there that could fix everything, but it's neither here or there, I finished yellow jackets! And apparently there's gonna be a new season 👀...I'll start from the start of my day, It started pretty chill, I did some work on game design, made a bunch a good progress if I do say so myself, then did a teensy bit of work on counting techniques, headed to campus. Wasn't feeling up to socializing at all, I think I don't know my default state anymore? It's like, I didn't really feel up to laughing at anyone's jokes or talking to anyone, and being around Ben was just awkward,and I know I'll get over it quickly, the in person interactions at least. Class went by, did some more work on game design, then had the call with Shivani which went well...I HAVE MICRKSOFT 365 NOW, that is, such a convenient relief!! And I can't believe I've slept on it till push came to shove and I had to use power query, anyways yeah I did show Shivani how to analyze the data. They got the data of 40 people but retakes gave us the data of 61 people, 61! In total, that's kinda close to a 100 🥹🥹. ..Anyways tho, I think they're under the impression that we did any actual work for Dr Qian which is a dang lie 😭, well, by actual work I mean actually interviewing children and stuff, I think she's focusing more on teaching now, I should stop by and say hi...Anyways tho, then we had operating systems which was cool, I worked out and lifted 265 on Bench which was sweet, when dumbbell pressing, the bench just kinda fell and I had 85s in my hand, twas a fun experience, thank God I didn't like drop the bar cause a lotta things could've happened wow. ..After that tho I got to chugging on legalmeasure, I made the UI earlier for manage user account functionality, but I have update password - just did, update email address, i added the toast component for alerts, did some more general polishing, and tomorrow I'm gonna style the toast. I also really wanna work on the OEE project but we also got our shell project!! Tomorrow is semi busy but I think we'll try to clean up our proj man presentation in the meantime and hopefully get started on the project..I'm slowly making good progress so thank God for that. Now I'm heading to bed to fix my sleep schedule. Cyaa

    Entry: IM BSCK IN BUSINESS BABYYYYY..I got my laptop charger from Dans house, thank God for a safe long 30 min awkward ish not really but kinda trip back and forward, but his dog is very feisty but she calmed down after a while. His brother John was also there and we talked about Plcs. We had sushi and did some coding, the sushi was aight, but idk, i don't like the Japanese cuisine very much, it's like, just okay, I had that one good sushi experience in that bar on my mind birthday, but this time, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, so that's about it. ..Also bad mochi balls with bean paste in them , that also wasn't great, it was interesting, not bad, just interesting. My younger brother is also back! An on a hurt scale of 1 to 10, im at a solid 1, which is nice ..I also got some progress on game design and I gotta catch up on legalmeasure. Unfortunalry game design takes priority but it's gonna be a grind! I think I'll just skip the class altogether on Sunday, or at least work on it in class, then I'll send John and Karen a follow up email just to let them know my progress. I'll send them an email on Wednesday, just so I have the time to polish stuff. ..I should try out casbin or whatever its called then Dan recommends, but I want to go simple for now. Leadedhsip stuff is gonna go down on Thursday, should be our last one!..In summary, tomorrow my focus is finishing game design, getting back on track with LM, and discrete readings

And I'm thinking of working on game design ..I am up pretty late, we were working on the sim assignment and it ended up with Ben rapping, I even recorded it loll. It just reminded me of the rap battles in vicsum with David? Dang it he did ea comics with me 😭😭, why can't I remember his name ..It semi brought back bad nostalgia tho, it's a feeling I can only hope to learn to deal with better, which I think I've been doing a decent job at lately, but yeah it was chill, essentially spent most of the day doing that a

    My mood Meh
    
    Entry: These have been quite unproductive days, but also kinda not, it just brings back memories of having nothing to do, but instead of being that extreme, I do have stuff to do but I'm taking a step back, forcefully I suppose cause no laptop Yay, and I just made banana bread and spent the day watching ATLA and YouTube shorts :*)...In terms of my emotions, I'm still very much, angry? Annoyed? Frustrated?, and I'm like semi ignoring him but ik it's not even helping cause I keep telling myself I need to collect my thoughts but it just ends up making me more and more frustrated cause there are things I wanted to say but didn't, and that's taking a lotta strength outta me,good old arguments in head moments. ..I'm catching myself at those points relatively quickly and stopping myself, or at least trying to calm myself to varying success rates. It does annoy me, greatly. We didn't get any work done on digital logic, and, well in good news, we are getting an extension for game design assignment 3. ..But still I'm still not over it and it's eating away at me and I find myself purposefully growing distant? And I also don't know if I want to change that anymore and if I'm just tired of dealing with all the baggage. Which reminds me, the sports tracker team had a call to catch up, I saw one of vexs response about his heart rate being high reminding him of bad times and it made me realize - and that made me realize that I should text him, so I did just now, well text the server, but still ..Tomorow I'll try to catch up on school work with DLC and Discrete...Speaking of which, my younger brother is at this, thingy away from home till Sunday I think. And it brought back memories of fall getaway, which now feels so far away it's insane, I feel like I forgot everything I learned and every way I grew there and it suckssssss, but I hope he's having fun. At least I get all the bed!..I also played me some sky!

Also pise sent this bop loll. https://youtu.be/mim1Ysx2Luc?si=f5Nv2o3YvjXiR4y5..Hmm did some work on project management, essentially finished my section, then honestly didn't get a ton of work cause, no laptop, but we are good, we are fine xD.

Now we are going to Dan's house on Sunday and I'm prolly gonna try to use this time to do something productive outside of computers, kinda reset my brain..I'm also unsure about the web dev field anymore, I wanna do some systems programming, low level magic!! Idk how far I'll go into it :*), but I do want to, I find it interesting.

    Entry: Pretty nice day, got some nice productive time  in ,combined with some good BG3 time, which I've made so much progress in, I beat orin, cazador, kileld Raphael and saved hope, got so much good loot, and now I'm off to help shadows parents. ..In terms of work, I started out fixing my resume lol, ik random but just wanted a small win, then worked on the oee project for a tiny while, then answered some emails, oh I'm also getting back into anime and I'm really enjoying psycho pass. ..But yeah, then I did work on legalmeasure and go admin page stuff set up with uploading documents, reworking the UI now for the create and edit. Tomorrow I'll have finished create, edit and delete templates functionality, along with starting on edit user account features, at least I hope so. My laptop charger is hanging on for its dear life and I'm scared of it's sparks 😭, I wanna go to Dan's house so we can fix it 🥹🥹..Yeah I'll ask him if we can come over this week or weekend. After that tho, I started on game design and made some eh progress, spent too long on the visuals..my ball still hurts, ish, but like only when I think about it, which kinda sucks, especially since I'd wake up and forget, then I'd remember and be like dang it brain stop! .I also made some association tests changes but it was super minor. Then topped off the day with yellow jackets and more coding. Pretty chill day, kinda uneventful, I'm not really learning anything new and the thrill of working with C and the filesystem made working on the lm website feel so, dry, software engineering in general tbh, now I wanna branch out, I've kinda always wanted to branch out to do new stuff. I like the backend stuff but even that's not scratching the itch? Maybe it's becsuse I'm becoming too engrossd in the field and trying to do things right and managing complexities that I'm getting threatened by it, and I do feel like that's partly the case. ..Whenever I work with backend code, I feel like I'm always doing sth wrong or I'm gonna get hacked which sucks, I have come pretty far as it relates to my sense skills, but soon enough I'll be  wondering again what the hek I'm doing with my life, making websites ..Feels so puny.

    Entry: Today was a very very productive day, even ended with some BG3. We got ls -R, mkdir, link (kinda), and cleaned up some other functions, so it's all essentially there ish, it's a pretty fun project, I like it a latt. No dlc for us tho, I basically spent the entire day coding, which is kinda fine with me. Didn't resist :(. Future me is gonna cringe at that. I did send an email to my leadership "mentor" and I didn't do coding club today cause I had absolutelamente no changes. Tomorrow we try to get things working ..Anyways I'm pretty tired so I'm headed to bed, everything with Ben got worked out

    Entry: Kinda split on this one, today was a weird day and I'm drooling and my head hurts, kinda, mis huevos, not as much right now, but it's maybe my head hurts so much, after I ate Rice in this dumb plastic plate and now my mouth tastes bad and is drooling and BRUHHH I didn't wanna throw the rice away, literally dumb ;-;. ..Anyways tho, class was okay, we came late but the stuff worked out pretty well. Also my mentor meeting is next week, AYYYY. I have so many emails to send, and I'm prolly gonna ask to reschedule the oee meeting to later during the week. ..Also Dan offered to buy my laptop charger replacement God bless him :*D..Okay the reason I chose great is mostly cause of Ethan, like for the entire day , well Ben was burnt out and was snarky and hostile from the very start which I didn't want to sour my mood or hinder getting work done, unfortunately it just progressed and he was like the only thing in good at is getting work done fast, which I haven't figured out if I should feel hurt by it or not, but like, I'm not taking it too seriously as emotions we're high..There are parts of the project I want to rant about like Andres lack ish of meaningful involvement, but like, it doesn't truly affect me so I am not overly bursting with emotions about it. ..We were able to get a lot of the commands working like CD, unlink, sync, mkdir, LS and it's variations, and creat, both CD and unlink were given to me by Ben and we didn't even get to the simulation assignment. But that's not the point, after I talked to Ethan and I'm really glad j did, I asked him how my communication has been and he was like he's vibing with me, and I'm giving with him too! Like being able to go back and forth and debug, and know that he does like a challenge, he loves a challenge and we can help each other debug and stuff, it's all great. We also talked about holding ourselves back cause of Wednesday Cru mostly, I friggin love Wednesday Cru. I gotta get back to reading the Bible...But yeah my talk with Ethan really elevated my mood, and now I'm tired with less of a headache and no more drool, and SPRING BREAK WOOO. It hasn't officially started yet but we'll get there...This is one of my longest entries in a while, but I've been slacckinggg so I have to catch you up, I don't talk to vex much anymore, or anyone in the fitness server tbh.  I occasionally pop in and it kinda sucks but I've accepted it,same with the sky server, there's a new update on housing and it does look fun and the environment looks nice but I'm still finding it hard to play without feeling lonely, blocking a buncha people unfortunately didn't help, maybe made it worse? ..Maybe I'll reconnect with them over spring break, but I'm planning on spending a maximum of 5 hours on actual school work per day, the number moved from 2 to 3 and now 5.  It's such a perfectly timed break as well cause a lot of us are already feeling the hit..In terms of the Ben stuff, I truly don't want to hurt our relationship more but I think it will be best if we just never worked on a project together. Maybe me Ethan and sarwar and Mohammed would be good, but that's still trying to get the best of the pack. ..Ok what else can I unwind, my dad stopped coughing!! And it does make me happy, really happy, theres always usually the feeling that there's always going to be something my mind if that makes sense, like if it's not one thing bothering me, it's going to be something else, it's prolly either just life now, or like life can't be perfect, life shouldn't be perfect, but sometimes I get reminiscent of times in my life where I didn't really have anything bothering me, but then again, it's like where there ever even times like that, there probably was always something, I still haven't forgotten the part of my life where my lack of ability to say no caused Richard to spend a grand on me for tutoring only to have me not take the SAT. That SUCKEDDDDDD..I owe a ton to him and Daniel, and a lot of people to be honest, so many people God put in my path to help me gain different skills and see things in different ways. Omg I think I already talked about the cat yesterday but just thinking of that lady! The one from yesterday, like, that amount of compassion for an animal!!not to like demean on animals lol, but if I could show that to other humans ..I think the entire thing that went on today is still weighing a bit on my mind, maybe a lotta bit on my mind, maybe that's what's contributing to the headache lol, I could look over the entire chat history and see where I failed to communicate, but for now I just want to focus on getting a successful project...In terms of other aspects of my life, I still need to talk to Dr Hill about paying my money into the school account! I've made minimal progress on legalmeasure which sucks, I'm listening to a lotta Steven universe music but Steven universe future kinda sucks, def no birding for me anymore :*(, passions change..I didn't even get to lift today! I'm going to add a new activity, conflict ..It was nice catching up tho, it feels like I've been holding in a lot, and it feels like I still kinda am, but we'll see

    Entry: THERE WAS A CAT outside of the fitness center, and I met this old lady but she's not really that old and she was so freaking nice and warm,and I'm so past up my bedtime, but the cats name was mayo and we found out that it's the fraternity's cat. She also introduced me to her, nephew? Idk she was eating with him and he did kinda look very awkward, but she was amazingly caring, like I don't think I've met someone like that in recent memory that could care so much about sth. I really wanna get a cat 😭😭..In other news tho, project management was hilarious, we stayed like 30 minutes after class and he said I should stay after because I was laughing., but he was chill and just told me that he knew who spotlighted Mohammed and knows they were in our group. I'm pretty sure he knows it was Ben 😭😭. But all in all it was still funny. ..My mum's doing someone else's shift so she's not gonna be home on Friday as well. In less happy news ..My balls are hurting again and it suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkksssss, and I'm like, ughh, it's not as bad as it was before, like I can sit relatively normally and stuff, it's in the same area so I'm assuming that doing cardio is what made it go back to this state. I'm just letting it do it's thing tho, I do not want to dwell on it, not again at least. ..In mid news, we made progress on the commands but we are still pretty far off, so rip

Technically 2 tomorrow. ..I don't have to worry about going to the march 16 event cause my brother is going as well, not transportation hassle. I also gotta get a car. ..There was cheese and crackers at Cru, and after dinner, and I also ate dinner at home so I'm pretty full, and also pretty incoherent right now 😭, but Andrew ganarin found out I was 18 and thought I was 22, and everyone'sike I look old 🥹, I gotta get a better skin care routine lol.

There are things I gotta stop identifying myself by, it'll do me well

I def know I'm not perfect but I much enjoy working with myself than in that team. Same thing with yesterday! I had to go to the computer lab to get work done just so I wasn't surrounded by them, also my laptop was dead but still. But I just started work back up on legalmeasure and I can't afford to do the projects alone , I so do not want to work in a project with either of them!!!! It's frustrating, i wasn't gonna put anything here but I don't wanna keep censoring how I feel, at least future me can look back on this

Also Ethan made me listen to a Hamilton song and it brought back memories ..Also in discrete structures, someone pulled down the projector thingy for the class and we had to move to a different class, and I sat by the window and it was amaaaaaszingggg, the breeze, it just felt nice, and calm, and the sun was perfect too, just thinking about it, woo, I just wanna lie there outside 🥹..Edit.My mum suggested me buying a hair texturizer and it seems like it could actually change my hair type :0, it's permanent ish, but like I could just cut it or keep it, idk how it'd look but I have to give it a shot right :")

Gale is trapped in prison lol...Most of my day was spent studying tbh, well, till 12:30 was mostly coding club stuff, then I did practice for discrete, which I'm not utterly confident about, but Ill practice more tomorrow, I did a teensy bit of digital logic studying, then tomorrow I'll do the same but with more of game design thrown in, I gotta make a plan or sth...My balls hurt ish, but I'm 92 percent sure it's because I sat weird for too long and some muscle in my inner thigh hurts and it's just kinda receiving that pain/ache.

    Entry: Okay we got some mixed bags today, a lot of sexual tension slash frustration already building up, and it sucks, and it doesn't help that mis huevos are now feeling risque and very very slightly achy but I think it's coming from somewhere else in my bag slash legs, and I forgot about it for like the past 2 hours so it's only when I truly focus on it. I'm sleeping pretty late again, I'm it sucks, I was on a call trying to help Ben and Ethan set things up, tomorrow I'm focusing on ds assignment for equivalence...I also booked my appointment, but it was with the girl, not muldowney, or at least I think so. And imma ask her if I need to pay, but idk if I should wait ;-;...I had an okay workout, didn't do all my exercises cause the benches were taken, terrible excuse ik, but I turned in my scholarship application! And Karen reached back to me in the most informal way possible 😭😭. Rn I'm mostly tired tho, I'm still trying to memorize the Ephesians verse...For I kneel before the father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives it's name. I pray that he may strengthen you with power through the spirit that lives in your inner being...

    Entry: I'm putting great because of Wednesday night Cru. Ethan made me stay and I loveddd the conversations, it felt like action group, but better. and we had chocolate dipped strawberry, side note, happy Valentine's! I had way too much sugar as well so sleeping should be fun. Dang it tomorrow is Thursday. I gotta schedule a flipping appointment, but yeah I really really enjoyed Cru, it felt so nice. I really gotta work on understanding God's love for me, and trying to beat this dang hold. The action group session was nice as it's helping me keep myself accountable, even though I was close to slipping this morning cause I was watching yellow jackets - the show is making me terrified of plane crashes. ..Good news! I got my operating systems quiz back and got a 31/25, yasssssss. He def over shot his niceness 🥹. Ben didn't do as well as he had hoped and he was bummed about it, we did talk a bunch about professors and stuff but my mum was def listening in on the convo and it just made me wanna stop. Apart from that tho, tomorrow, we turning in game design project 😤, no baldurs gate this weekend, I gotta study for game design midterm, then get fully started on operating systems. we gotta get a planning session going..Oh! I emailed Karen and John, and I did a cardio workout, I also gotta catch up on discrete homework, maybe even do some digital logic studying.my elbow still hurts and it sucks cause I don't wanna train it while it's down, so I'm just gonna do another leg day, gotta catch up on them anyways...Oh! I also talked a bunch with aless and I said I'm gonna talk with him about religion, should be fun! But that should about wrap up my day, tomorrow is me finishing up game design , at least only 2 classes tomorrow WOO!..I also had a dream about karnaugh maps lol

We get two weeks though and Ik it's a group project for a reason, but I might just rant to Ethan lol, I'll think about it for a while and make the decision today

    Entry: Feeling pretty good, just got back from action group and it was pretty nice. Talked a lot with Bryce about what we look for in a relationship and I came to the conclusion that physical touch is my love language. ..We.also had chili at Andy's house which was nice, and I had a killer workout which I will be feeling tomorrow. I'm doing mostly legs because my elbow still hurts. Also at the start of my workout, Holly called and said that muldowney asked for a follow up! It's for the blood pressure thing and I am pretty now kinda nervous about it, even though itl only make things worse, but I think I should be good. I'll go in tomorrow for a follow up and maybe as him questions about sweating and cramps, so I'm setting a reminder for tomorrow!..We didn't get our OS qui today and I'm very much bummed about it 😭, but I'm still waiting. Also side note, I got very reminiscent about the kind of stuff that are in this journal, things that I've probably forgotten and memories that probably wouldve stayed in my subconscious, feels like a maze or ziggurat of memories, I'll spend tonight looking through some of it. Especially because I was talking to Andy about Betty la fea and I got so reminiscent of when I used to watch it and how giddy It made me! Emotions I haven't felt in a while, waiting for the result to the grading of the os quiz feels like that, but a lot more toned down..Except now I have a headache which isn't very cash money

My dads still coughing which is worrying!!, I think he has sleep apnea and idek how to be like, you're still coughing? To him. ..Today went by super quickly. I made good progress on game design and stayed in Dr das Guptas office hour for three hours with Ben. Andre also took his exam then ..The air feels like it's going to rain which honestly I've missed a lot. The slight cold chill of the impending rain, ugh yass. ...I even worked out today and it was intense , but great! Dang I gotta do the oee stuff tomorrow. Also luckily my meeting with my mentor wasn't today, twas next week...Also my mum has been in a good mood lately and I haven't had a reason to use hurricane mum for like a year now, at least from what I can remember. It's strange lol. Also I have a slight headache :-:

    Entry: Ok I'm home and I'm feeling pretty good. Honestly I might just work on my game design or play some baldurs gate. The appointment! The big appointment. It went well! Apart from my blood pressure being a bit high but it was 138/77 or sth like that, which I don't consider to be too bad 😤. The dude was nice, and the girl at the reception had to get the bigger blood pressure machine wrist thingy cause of mis biceps xD. ..Ofc I was awkward at first, but then I just let it out and he was like, ok, and then he *examined* me and my bit wasn't excited to stay down loll, but he said everything looks and feels fine, which is a relief, and now the pain or even mostly discomfort is when I'm in the car and it's all bumpy, but all other times now I can ignore it or don't feel it which is big progress...Side note, I've been dreaming a lot about David troupe. I should send him a message again :(.but yeah! The appointment went really well. Project management also went well, it was hilarious. I also had a semi deep talk with Ben about releasing technology to people that could be used to do harm or not. Im finding that holding myself back from being immediately dismissive is very helpful, who'd have thunk it :*)..Even went to the seed meeting after the appointment and it was cool, I saw Christian and talked to Kasheem. ..I even worked out!! And it feels nice again, and the weights moved really nicely too, my body needed the break a bit..I didn't/still don't feel very productive. Just because a lot of the classes works are due in like 2 weeks. So I could finish leaderships work now, but I'd rather not? Yeah I'll work on game design

The woman there was super nice and she already knew my brother. ..I got the person I'll be seeing and I couldn't find anything on him online 🥹🥹. Should be fun. But at least I'm glad it's a dude.  ..I'm really enjoying listening to bubbly by good kid, the song just clicked and I'm loving it xD..Also we are getting takeout cause no yam for porridge! ..I also have a few things I gotta talk about here, and it kinda sucks. In good news, OS quiz was good, I believe, I think I did well on it but we'll see 🥹

    Entry: Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day. Im decently tired and just spent the last 2 hours with Ben and Ethan talking about filesystems. It hurts less and is more easy to ignore now, but it's still gonna be interesting. I talked to vex a bit, and went to the career fair, idk if I mentioned it here, some.dude and I were going in the same direction all the way to the bathroom loll. I got one of my fingernails stuck in my gum 😭...Proj man class was boring cause of his policy ;-; and I had a meeting with Andy which was cool. Last night I had 4 dreams!, and one felt like an alternate reality where David was outside in a car and was like, let's goo, and I left with him after praying with my parents? It was a weird dream and kinda short but it kinda gave me a glimpse into idk, a different reality

    Entry: So I went to the wellness center and the person there said I can do walk in appointments for 40 dollars! Which is super cheap! And a steal imo, and I can ask questions and do a checkup. Rn I'm leaning towards doing that, I'm planning on doing it tomorrow, it's feeling better now, much better than yesterday I'll say, but ill still go and ask questions just in case. Rn I'm leaning on it not being anything serious, epididymitis is the current theory, or at least just a slight bruising from going the jumping jacks or laying in bed and having one of the thingys rest on it weird. ..But that's essentially my theory, it's not torsion cause that's insanely.painful and straight to er, and no lump, so I'm feeling better, and the pain is much bearable, so I think tomorrow definitely I'm walking in and making an appointment. I feel good about that decision.

    Entry: Mostly feeling bad cause Andre got picked for jury duty and he seems like he's struggling a lot and I really don't know how to help...Im gonna check up on him tomorrow. ..I talked to Dr mina and the contract is still getting finalized so I can chill on working. That way I can focus on other stuff, tomorrow imma work on the simulation. Hmm what else, went to action group, and talked with Chris, Im thinking of reserving my comments about him, to myself..yeah I don't wanna be judgy. ..The hurt isn't going away per se, but it's when I'm sitting that it hurts, and there's no lump so yay, also pee is normal, so I feel like I should be fine, but idk, part of me is still bothered by it and idk what to do? Telling my parents seems harder than just letting it be..I'm so dropping the ball when it comes to talking with Jared, he seems like he's making an effort to communicate and I do suck not really pushing for it ;-;. Imma get him!,..I also talked to Gabbie about reading and her wedding. I feel like lately there's not a lot that I've been meaning to talk about and my mood has kinda stagnated, I think this, injury, imma call it, is doing something to me. Idk what that is but something. ..I couldn't even workout properly today cause my left elbow hurts and I don't wanna exacerbate it. Everything else just makes it worse too, bruh sometimes it feels like I'm not the one writing this, I'll read back and realize I don't remember typing what I typed. Maybe the tired brain kicking in. ..I also had a bunch a smoothie and enchiladas for dinner

Andre went to the pistons game, with a friend I assume. And I worked on game design and digital logics hw. They were all pretty straightforward and I'm pretty happy with my progress so far. Also just made the custom UI for reset password and it took less than an hour, also some back and forth with Shivani about the website, also, played baldurs gate woo! Now I'm puckered out and ready for beds. Gotta brush my teeth first tho..Also continuing watching Stevens universe and I'm enjoying it

    Entry: Woke up so early but semi refreshed, like, 5am to 6am early, so I just laid in bed scrolling on Reddit :*), mis huevos still hurt but I'm less worried about it. At least I'm trying to not think too much about it. God willing the pain will go away on its own 🥹. ..It's weird being pain free than having pain, then missing the pain free times because we never appreciated them, but even like now I'm still relatively pain free. I can't imagine a debilitating injury or sth like that, it would suckk...Today was wholly productive tho,got some OEE changes done before the meeting, then worked on finishing authentication for legalmeasure and I'm essentially done! The features work really well, and I haven't come across any weird bugs. Apart from the date.now() vs now in the schema bug which I'm so glad I found. I have resend code, reset email, logging in, and even the navbar changes all working, with authentication before routing, and after with pinia. I might write more tests. Also did more stuff for LD ibtANDD found out we had some dlc homework plus some new one, I did learn as well about karnaugh maps..Also! Did digital logic circuits and sent Andre some piston tickets, today was pretty productive, even chatted with alegs. Listened to some Spanish music. Tomorrow's gonna be game design! And Os and some DLC, cause we have an upcoming quiz and exam

I did a bunch a coding today and I think it was productive but wow doing auth is amazingly tedious. The pages are coming together and I'm hoping to get login functionality done tomorrow, then maybe Sunday I can focus on testing, catching up on classes cause I literally did no class work today 🥹...I didn't even workout today 🥹🥹. I was able to implement the full auth process today tho, which I think is decently quick and I am happy with my progress. Managing the state with the auth for the FE is a pain tho ..Also I really did get 42 on ds quiz so yay

    Entry: Got some good coding done today!! Finished sign up flow essentially, also did a lot of learning about firebase, authentication, csrf attacks which rely on another site making a request to ur site doing and the browser sending the necessary cookies automatically + without knowing. It's kinda cool and not as difficult to understand as I thought before. But I'm using firebase to retrieve the jwts and headers to pass them, then I'll use firebase admin to verify the token for the Middleware and get the uid which I'm storing in the user account, essentially separating the user from the users account, hopefully it'll allow them to easily change emails if need be, cause the only thing that'd need updating is the uid as that's what connects the two. I'm happy with the implementation and it did take a while for me to settle on one ..I didn't go pure sessions route because of the hassle with session tokens and passing them as cookies and then trying to secure them and it really wouldn't be worth my time so firebase FTW! Project management class was hilarious. ..Discrete structures was graded and I got a great grade which I know I don't deserve like bruh. Same with os quiz 1, the man Is too good 🥹...Anyways tomorrow I kinda flip things up and I focus on multisim, I did start discretes homework and am already reading up on os class work to get read for assignment 2 with the filesystems.

    Entry: I'm very interested to see how my schedule and business would develop over this semester, it's gonna be something 0-o. Dr dasgupta got in an accident today but he's fine and still went to os class, that man's something else. ..Andre was able to finish his os assignment I think, I've full on started with coding for legalmeasure and was able to get some good progress today, now I'm working with firebase and I asked Dan what he thinks cause Im still not confident in the whole thing, especially since I'm using firebase with node, which I guess I always do anyways? But I never have a server to run it on and it's just the front end so idk how different it'd be. ..I'm also thinking of things like security risks and I'm prolly gonna have to talk to Dan again, I'm leaning towards sessions but those might complicate the whole process. Hmm I prolly should be fine. I've already got the user being registered which, yay! Was super quick, apart from the cors error we don't talk about lol, but tomorrow imma make sure to finish the sign up functionality, along with setting up mongo, and hopefully doing the login functionality from there. My goal rn is to finish milestone 1 by the end of the week and I think I can do it! ..But you know, idk if I should be tracking my hours 😭😭, I know I probably should, I've worked on this for a good like 5 ish hours this week, which is a good amount of time already, maybe even much more and I'm now in the stretch of the week with not a lot to do. I think tomorrow, I'll focus on reading up on operating systems and file systems cause we have a quiz soon, then doing discretes new homework, and over the weekend I really want to catch up on game design!!..I'm off to bed now tho, ciao! I think I'll start doing that. For Mon wed and fris since we leave for 1,..New game design idea: fps Pac-Man with horror elements BUT WITH RPG ELEMENTS LOL, like you get attacks and you have to roll a good attack

I got started on legal measure and the UI is coming together quite nicely, even though after a while I do get tired of looking at it and some proportions are not proportioning 🥹. ..We had Cru and had a lot of people - 11, and it snowed! And my brother got his tires fixed, so today had a nice vibe. Highlight of the day was a pushup contest to see who can do the most pushups in one minute, i got 48!!! That's literally my highest pushups record and I haven't done them in so long. I had a weird dream last night where Elijah from Central was in the bathroom with me, then he suddenly spat on me, I woke up immediately 😂😂, just the shock of it all, but I stayed awake from like 6 to 7 30 just scrolling on Reddit before I got the day fully started. ..Classes were cool, we were dissing Ben in the chat and it was hilarious. My workout was cool, overall pretty chill day, time to head to bed tho...OH I ALSO POSTED KN REDDIT

Sent an email to Shivani and tehani and they had some changes so I got them done real quick, oh snap I didn't put in my hours, commented on others leadership maps, and that was chill... Hmm then went on campus, my brothers tires are a dud so he's driving slow 0-o. ..OS and discrete class were fun, game design was fine ig, did some more work on ibt CAUSE THERE WAS A BIG BUG where the test data wasn't getting stored cause of invalid titles in firebase, that's a big issue yo!!!! ..Anyways fixed it, Karen and Dr mina didn't send me an email but I'm still tempted to start just to get an heads up, honestly I'm gonna start, I'll start setting things up tomorrow >:). Rn we have simulation assignment and project management to focus on. Also I'm pretty excited for working on legal measure, I still have moments of fear, but they're much less, as long as I don't over think it...Oh also in action group, I had this very smoky type tea and it kinda brought me back to fall getaway. Also I talked to Cru Ben and it was kinda nice to reminisce about Nigeria, which was cool...So now Andre knows where I live xD, had a nice workout too, did 255 for 5. My elbow still bums out, which sucks, maybe it's time to invest in elbow straps 🥹. ..Oh! Some professor messaged me on LinkedIn about hearing about me and he said cool portfolio :D, then I realized my projects are definitely broken so rip 😭, I gotta fix the cronjobs

I was able to get the leadership map turned in, my social issues essay, and I got to a great stopping point in the OS assignment so I got some baldurs gate time..Also glad I didn't go to the wedding cause something was wrong with my brothers tires and if I had gone, I'd have strongly disliked every every second of it. ..Also had a meeting with Dan today and he was in a great mood, I don't think I've seen him like that in a while, he was so expressive, idk it was cool tho, the project might be starting in 2 days so I gotta brace myself!!!..I'm tired of people complaining about work or telling me that ill get burned out, mostly the first one, partly the second one because I can see myself believing it and it causing me to start feeling burned out, but as I was peeling potatoes, I realized that only I controlled how I felt, and as long as I was in touch with my emotions through stuff like writing on here and praying, then I'll be okay. Also I want to end every journal with may God's will be done because I'm finding that my desire for seeing the future and hoping that I'm not on some path to destruction is pretty high, wow I'm tired...Tomorrow I'll finish the OS assignment and start reading more for discrete, I forgot about the quiz, and just remembered, but it shall be forgotten again..Omg how do I almost forget to put this here, I finished schitts creek and I wanna cry 🥹🥹, also I learned that David, John, and TWILA are related!!

Also I gotta text Dr Hill about final round of tuit remiss. I haven't seen him a lot..I'm trying not to worry about discrete structures quiz, even though I'm not stressed about it, really, it's kinda weird, but sometimes I did worry about it and my performance especially compared to others, there was a point in my workout where I was looking at myself and I felt so different, like I was just piloting a body or sth, and I was like, dang, that's me...In less meta talk, I'm doing OS assignment and I should be able to get it done by tomorrow God willing, no wedding for me 😭

    Entry: Ok I think I'm back to baseline, which is good :), but I had a banging headache for a good chunk of the day which sucked. Omg project management was hilarious, Dr Daimi made me and my brother stay behind to ask us who didn't attend the class, and he then asked who the older brother was 😂, then he was like, is he scared of me xD, mofe was 200 percent salty, but I was just laughing, Elias also asked if we were twins and why we were in the same class, I also chilled in the seed room for a while, and actually did get interested in the meeting with Dr nafea so maybe I'm not gonna drop out after all. ..I'm less stressed about everything now, BUT WHEN I THINK OF IT, like now that I'm thinking of it, it's like the sense of, not terror, but, yeah terror, of everything going wrong, like I'm imagining me crying as I'm whisked away just because I wanted to make money or pursue opportunities, and the possibility of that scares me. I think my reaction is much stronger and averse than reality if that makes sense, probably not, but like, time will tell, and as much as I would like to rely on God for this, it's hard for me to see myself doing so! Iand even that saddens me ..In happier news :*), I am enjoying C and I was able to get echo to work :D, buttt idk if I'm enjoying C because I'll probably pick it up faster than others, or if I'm truly enjoying it. I think I'm enjoying it as enjoying it goes, but maybe I still haven't spent enough time with my bum self to differentiate the reasons for my emotions

    Entry: Ok I was very much not at baseline earlier cause Ben and I had an argument but we resolved it so it was good I'd say. I didn't get the leadership map done but I started the PowerPoint. I'm finishing it tomorrow and recording the video 😤. I might even do it early in the morning so that I have time to study for the discrete structures quiz. I wasn't worried about it before, but Andre made me worried so I'm gonna go over the homework again lol. I cut my workout short and it kinda was for the best even though I wanna stop doing that, it was mostly cause my back was hurting and I was gassed and felt like I couldn't do more volume. It's pretty late, and the inside of my mouth still hurts ;-;..I'm buying my new charger tomorrow! Also I may talk to Dr nafea about dropping out of the meetings but hopefully maybe coming back on, tomorrow might be my last day, we'll see, it's an expense I'm willing to take. I'll also be fine with dropping my leadership minor to be honest, but I might have to talk to Dr mina about it, and wait to see if her and Karen can work out something so I can get tuition reimbursed without any hassles 🥹. They're probably drafting up a contract or something..Something was said at action group about whether we are trying to write our own story or getting God write it for us and it bugs me cause idk what God is writing for me and it feels like prayer is genuine cause I'm trying to get him to help me write my own story, I might talk to Andy about it..Ok so tomorrow plan, leadership map and discreet structures studying. I like that plan. My younger brother also got a piano lol . Also had a meeting with Molly. Tomorrow doesn't seem to be too busy, which is great! If I get out of the nafea meeting, that's one hour to myself, I'll take it

    My mood Meh
    
    Entry: Ok I'm feeling slightly better, but I'm still definitely below baseline. I was able to weasel my way out of going to the highschools, and now I'll be working with Mackenzie to do it on campus, I was thinking of doing the seminar thingys for ACSO and seed but ill have to talk to Dr Hill ..We worked a bunch on the circuits assignment and made good progress but we are very much not done yet. The stuff makes sense, and I'm enjoying working on the simulations and stuff, but the business of my schedule just sukkks. ..In maybe good news, my body and brain can't decide on which one it is. Karen really liked my mockups according to Dr mina. It looked very professional, thanks Eb Garamond xD, I'm reay glad she did tho, and she's like I can get paid! And Dr mina was able to bargain my contribution 😂 and I'm sure she talked me up so much, but she was like, this is ezzz, and I'm like, oh lawd it's not as easy as she might think 😭, bu I have 8 weeks! 20 hours a week, for 30 dollars an hour, so 4800 flat fee for phase 1! ..At first I didn't think that was a lotta money necessarily, but it kinda is. At least for me. Oh I turned down Richards invitation to do yte this Saturday and I really can't, wowee Ive been busy for a day in the past, but sustained busy ness, it's kinda a weird feeling. Will I finally sacrifice my sleep? Is this a new arc in my life. ..It's a lot to think about, also in terms of tuition remission, I'm hoping that I'm fine, I really really get bogged down about like what the process is going to be like and stuff, it seems like dean snyder will have to sign a contract with them on my behalf?  And then they pay the school and then the school tuition reminded me. Its def a lot...I'm smelling smoke 0-o. I'm in the car right now. Dang it that side tracked me, but essentially, yeah the process seems like it might be a lot. I don't want to have to talk to the international office, and I don't really want to have to back out of the project, even though I'm sure that Karen and John will understand. It wouldn't be very cash money :*). ..So I'm gonna talk to mis padres tonight and be like, this is what I'll be doing, Dr mina knows my situation that I can't be paid in check, I'm kinda glad she's doesn't push further and ask a lotta questions, not that I'm hiding anything, but like, it's a topic I don't like talking about since it's so out of my control, and that's what's causing all my uncertainty about the issue and why I'm so not cash monied to work. Dr mina also said I can do it all alone loll, which I guess works for me. Dang ive been journaling for the entire way home and I'm not even done. I am excited about the project and the prospects of working for them. But then again it's like, she's with the LAW school, well technically she is external to udm, maybe as a partnership with them or something, but the idea that she's related to the law school is not putting me at peace. ..So it very much seems like over the next few days, they'll be writing a contract that I'll sign, that's like I'll do this and this and this feature over the course of 8 weeks for the payment of 4800, one time. I told Dr mina that the best way and hopefully she got that the only way to pay me with T.R, and she prolly got it and she's gonna relay it to Karen who's going to figure out how to set everything up and if it's possible. Dr hill did TR and so did Dr Qian, so deep breathes..Cru was fun at least, we had Bucharest and were laughing during prayer :*)

    Entry: I was gonna go great before, but to be honest action group kinda drained me, it took about 4 ish hours outta my day, 30 mins was kinda chatting with Andy, and we talked about the matter of purity :*). If how many days ago me, nope ,no ragrets, kinda, def ragrets, just gotta keep moving forward. I do feel drained, but I'm glad I was able to catch up on some work🥹, I got a 10 on the game design assignment, and he did see my comments so yay. ..We stopped by Andy's house to get food, we as in Me and Titus, and it was chill, but partly I was just worried about my mum being like, why are you out late, and I was technically ;-;. Could.be better could be better. There's a snow storm tomorrow and it seems like school wouldn't be cancelled and it sucks. I feel sucky RN in general, action group brought out the introvert in me and I didn't really feel comfortable talking to anyone except Titus and Bryce. Os class was online cause Dr dasgupta left his phone at home. I had a decent workout, cru had the in eboard call and I tried setting up Nixos more to little avail..AND I shouldn't feel sucky because, had to take a pause to email Shivani that I could meet, but dang I am bussssy, I thinks I got the job for LegalMeasure, and I should be joyous yay, but we haven't even discussed payment and we def gonna need to get on a meeting to discuss, and I need to look at all the features and come up with a realistic deadline! Plus hours per week, and ish sucks cause I gotta study and stuff. ..Okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get out of the bathroom, and go to bed. My dad's still coughing and it's helping the suckiness,NOW I FEEL SUCKIER

    Entry: Today was a busy day! At first I was going to use it for catching up on dlc reading and homework, but apparently not :D, I should make chin chin! I might do it tomorrow lol. But essentially Karen emailed and wanted me to make a document so I decided to compile a list of the technologies we could use. It was. A long list, essentially 3000 words, plus research. I didn't mind thinking through the process tho, backend is so much more complicated than the front end - sometimes, most times. ..Apart from that tho, then I did the unity assignment cause I knew it would weigh me down. Part of me is slightly worried I didn't do it right, but I also know that part of me can be a bum, and even if I get a 5/10,it's not the end of the world. Ben I and Andre are gonna be working together on the multisim assignment but I am still gonna make all the circuits on my own. There was an eboard meeting about the wedding for ACSO, I played BG3, but I'm trying to think of what else occupied my time, it was 10 like 2 minutes ago. Like, ..I did the document and emailed it, which was at like 3? Then I started game design and ended also at like 5 it 6? Then gamed till 8, dinner, did some multisim, and that was about it. I guess I felt a lot more busy over the day, but that's not to say that I wasn't actually busy.  My inside left leg feels weird and I still think it's cause my legs are very very sore ..Also I had a dream about taking an OS test lol, and I'm sure I'll be dreaming about becoming a druid tonight. Hasta luego chico

There's also a fair amount of things I wanna say but I might leave them for tomorrow, Karen emailed me.back with questions and I'll respond tomorrow, Dr das was able to respond to my email so I could resubmit my quiz, and we are starting a DND campaign soon!!..I also played a bit with nix packages..I also spotted a schitts creek enjoyed out in the wild

    My mood Motivated
    
    Entry: CRU might be in trouble! And I just got motivated in a way that I haven't felt in a very long time, like, focused motivation to keep cru on the good side of the student life. For now I'm hoping we can set up a meeting with Andy Maddie etc etc to discuss everything and how we can keep pushing forward!..Also I had a great workout, and my.legs are SOREEE, even almost cramped on squats so I didn't do my last reps, did 315 on deadlifts, and noble was surprised that i could do it without any belt, I EVEN DID IT WITH NO STRAPS, it's 3 reps of course, but my lower back got a workout in too, it's fine now tho, it was definitely.pumped...The three reps moved smoothly and I could see him watching me😂, but then it moved on to squats and I lowered the weights, gotta check my pride, my form was good I think, I didn't do curls cause my.biceos are still tenderr...Then I did rows and lat raises, oh and did I forget to mention, THE FREAKING SENATOR GARY PETERS WAS AT UDM! AND I MET HIM AND SHOOK HIS HAND,. IT WAS WEORD , Andre was with me, and I was so giddy 🤣 we walked around udm a few times and a random person texted me about whether he showed up yet 😭😭..There was also the Dean's pasta dinner, and Dr Hill invited Ben and I to eat, but we said no, and JAMES KENNey came, from the sports tracker group for oriekaose and he was literally telling us things about udm that I NEVER knew or considered 😭😭, like the location of the tunnels and how to get there and secret entrances to places, it was amazing 😂, then we talked about the sports tracker project, Ben and I worked on the digital logic quiz and we got an extra credit question which saved me 1 point 🥹, that I am of course going to argue in class :D, but we'll see, I got a 15/15, tho so I'm not miffed. ..I'm gonna set up hypr land with Nixos eventually!..Also finished and cleaned up OS quiz, for now I might clean up my leadership journal, but I think I need a break..I'm also still reading fuel and the flame and I had one of those moments today where I felt like everything was spiraling and I had to get a grip? On myself and everything, and I find that with faith, and God, especially when it's on my mind a lot, then I have something firm to stand on? It makes me more secure in myself essentially

    Entry: Ok my sentimonies from my last entry have kinda dissipated, just a little tho, because I was able to make changes to the ibt that makes the button click randomized but with a limit of 3, Yas please, even ai was being a bum about it. I signed myself up to talk to senaTor GaRy PeTeRs tomorrow!! WHY? DONT ASK ME, and I'm trying not to think too hard about it, Andre will be there so we'll be fine 🥹🥹. And good thing it's tomorrow so I don't have time to worry loll, I was also able to partly understand the last question of the OS quiz, and now I'm boutta deeep dive into how C works...Essentially here's what I did today ..Redid dlc homework on paper and turned it in .Did leadership reading, all three chapters essentially - essentially cause I couldn't be bothered by the last two, then wrote a draft for my journals ..Started reading dlc chapter 2,..Did ibt changes and emailed it in ..Finished and cleaned up OS work ..Still very sore so didn't workout :(, emailed Molly about pushing our meeting and then responded to Dr bani Taan for the thing with Gary Peters, cool! ":D. Tomorrow I'll fully finish operating systems and do more in depth stuff on C, and we'll c how things go with senor Peters, I'm talking about the gee research, which I worked on so I can talk a lot about it and answer questions

    Entry: Had a great workout today, and by great, I mean super exhausting and I needed an hour for my brain to kick into working mode. I find that time flies by these days, a lot more than Id think, like I started to do the operating systems quiz by 9, and I wanted to get it finished as quick as possible by the end of the day, but I think that since I'm interested in this stuff, I wanna try to learn as much from it as possible, lol I'm pulling a Ben, but ig it's true?..Tomorrow I'll finalize my circuits homework and turn it in. But it also seems like the DTE project got cancelled? I had been meaning to ask him about it, and I gotta block out time to test the site before sending it to shiv and teh, terrible nicknames wow 😂, John and Karen still haven't responded and I wanna cry 😭, maybe they're meeting to look over it or sth, idk 🥹🥹🥹. ..Que sera sera 🥹🥹😭, ..Oh oh I downloaded nix os and got a very big scare that I overwrote mint 😭 but everything worked out in the end. The plan for tomorrow is tomorrow morning, finish up dlc homework, and start the next reading. I also have leadership reading to catch up on, so tomorrow will be a reading heavy day, fun! ..Also im very much tired of just complaining about classes and readings and stuff, Its not something I'd care to put here even, but in general I'm not interacting with conversations like that..I'm really looking forward to action group, and Ethan's signing up for mission trip which I think is sick

    Entry: Today was pretty great as well. I wore my white shoes and Allen and Andy + Gabbie (kinda)  complimented me 🥹. Cru was nice and action group is even starting back up and I already told mis padres! I did some work, had a BIG PANIC OVER THE EMAIL NOT SENDING TO EITHER JOHN OR KAREN AND NOW THEY HAVENT RESPONDED AND I WANT TO CRY 😭🤞😭😭😭, WELL SEE WHATHAPPENS BUT FOR NOW IM GOINF TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT..WOOOOOSAH. 😭😭 ..I wasn't ultra busy, but I had the leadership class and we talked about step up and I'm still not sure how it feels. I'm slightly excited, but also very nervous for it, which is natural at this.point, I'm kinda used to having the feeling of fear for new experiences, so I'm not gonna make my choice based on that feeling. ..Ben has been trying to villianize me a lot, from the Christian incident to the seed call and kicking him from the meeting to calling me manipulative to saying I'd know about circular reasoning to calling me annoying for writing notes for questions in project management to thinking the color trippy illusion thing is all about him, and writing it all down I'm getting annoyed but it hasn't reached a tipping point so I'll bide my time!..I was watching Nickelodeon stars then vs now and dangg they've changsd. I was also talking to Andre about baldurs gate and the game is so freaking fun

    Entry: Busy but productive day, turned in project management work, turned in dlc work, did discrete structures homework, made that question 3 in the ld test a dang table, also made a new link, so I'm essentially done as it relates to all the changes! Gonna do more testing to make sure everything is tip top tho. Did discrete structures homework, played baldurs gate at the end and got to a spot that I know will progress like 4 storylines, gonna do my upper body workout tomorrow, read dlc textbook again, I'm hoping to get very good at spacial thinking, like doing stuff in my head..I think I was able to achieve every big goal I wanted today, I EVEN FREAKING EMAILED DR BANI TAAN ABOUR DROPPING OUT OF CNXNS HECK YEAH..And Ive gotten so much better at casually emailing professors to ask them questions, I'm tempted to change today to great, I did have some good laughs ..It was also cold today, I'm making a new happy emotion, for when happy ish is too gloomy but great is too good..BAM!..Mantas also had a bug that took him the entire day to fix but was because of a dang Boolean variable for loading 😭

    Entry: Today was aight I guess. I did a TON of coding. Nothing especially challenging, except I got GitHub copilot, which I don't think I've mentioned, and it solved a problem. For me that I didn't want to write myself, then I was about to get down the amazing rabbit hole of self doubt and wondering if I could do it better or how it thought of it and if I could think of sth like that and i think I was able to push past it decently quickly, but it was still there. ..I understand it's implementation tho, and I even learned sth new about tailwind and JavaScript, the .every method and @apply and layer in TW. I started coding at around 8, and finished at like 4. I think I spent like a minimum of 5 hours. I made some changes and refactored some code. My next goal is to write a compiler in C lol, idek C but that's how I'd learn. ..No School tomorrow wooo!! Ethan semi beefed with Ben and Andre semi beefed with Ben and I didn't like my reaction to either situation, well, not like I had a big reaction. Essentially for future mes reference, well, I guess the tame interpretation is that it's good not to be on the receiving end of the drama, but when I feel indifferent or only consider how it would affect me when dealing with others issues, then I gotta reconsider how I'm treating people. My 'be nice to ben' operation is in full go though, days. Maybe it's my interactions with them that's causing me to react in ways I would not like to react in when situations like these arise, but if I can get to a situation where I see both of them like I see Ethan, I think we would be good..I already have a plan for tomorr.ow. AND IM FREAMING DROPPING OUT OF THE DUMB CNXNS THING AAA..Also I'm looking into getting a new laptop 0-o..I also watched the new southpark movie and it did not lead to a happy outcome . I have a plan laid out for tomorrow so we will see how well I can stick to it..Also I forgot me falling in the puddle while 'skating' with Simon happened 😂😂

    My mood Unsure
    
    Entry: Yo something has been happening to my will, it's like, I'm staying up way too late rn, well, better worded, something is happening to my constraint. Two choices I've made today, be nicer to Ben, listen to my head! And not my whatever makes me keep playing BG3 for much longer than I planned. I think part of me is still in the break mentality. On the good side , to be a bit more positive, I turned in my leadership journal, and worked a bunch more on the digital logic circuits assignment, along with operating systems practice and coding club call, even some project management sprinkled. On the downside, I didn't resist temptation, I woke up a bit miffed and playing shadow fight made me more miffed so my day started out pretty angrily. Even though I sound like I was productive, I don't feel productive. ..Just a break to discuss something funny that happened but as my parents were parking the car got stuck in the snow so we had to push it and the dirty snow water sprayed on me lol. Dang I should've washed my hands after xD...Also got on a call with Ben, Joe, Ricardo and andreas for a while. Ricardo is flipping funny, I don't give him enough credit. I also kinda throw Ben under the bus and can see when that's happening and I still go along with it, so I've decided to stop messing with Ben, I know he still very much harbors some, maybe resentment is a big word, but resentment towards me, and I feel like I do fuel it. Especially since I keep realizing that I absolutely do not like being commanded to do something by him, but then again, ive definitely made him feel worse over other stuff, and Its not like it's not for the good of the team, with me.being in the team! And slacking off only hurts me, and the team, so i am kinda regretting my behaviors, and I suppose reflecting here is going to help me change how I interact with him, no more demeaning him or trying to put him down...Andre has also been struggling with his mum and fafsa stuff and I do feel bad for him, and Idk if there's anything I can do to help, he's very much in a bad mental state , I'm frustrated on his behalf because I can only like 20 percent relate to what he's feeling, and even then it still majorly sucked!..Ethan's chilling, I don't got no gripes with him lol, I got him to test out manjaro Linux and I hope he's liking it. He has a lotta free time this semester which, good for him. Right now I might be in my more free periods. I think I can take advantage of it, but even then, I'll be seeing most of my time spent into studying for classes like DLC and discrete structures, which I still need to reread the txtbook..Ok game design isn't due for a while. I have a plan for tomorrow that I intend on following. I do worry about not having time to stusy, but I should be fine

    Entry: Ending the streak was a bad idea, it always is isn't it. I SHOULDNT BE FEELING BAD, IT SNOWED A LOTT today! And now it makes me feel worse AAA. I played some baldurs gate, so maybe I feel better? And I got some DLC homework done, I sent the email and did the recording to Karen and John. The email didn't send to John but I'm hoping Karen would share it with him, I'll prolly resend it tomorrow. And then there's acso stuff I'm just gonna reply to tomorrow, I didn't even workout, this is not a good way to end an honestly pretty fun day, UGH, I had hot cocoa, it snowed! I was alone in the library, walked in the snow, was driven in the snow, did two he's in a good enough way, even did the leadership journal. And now it's almost 12 and I'm here sulking. ..Ok here's what I'm gonna do...sleep, tomorrow, we turn in leadership work, we work on OS, and we maybe relax a bit

    Entry: Mid day, "mid day", entry, essentially EOD entry, but I was just realizing that I dont open up as much anymore, idk if it's the subconscious feeling like I'd feel ike.im.showing off, but little things like that. I was telling Ben that I was busy cause of school and other things outside of school, and I didnt feel the need, or even want to rattle off about the stuff I'm working on, not that they're mind shattering good, or even anything special, but still, I still don't really have an answer, but I kinda wonder how much I'd change if I became much much more open, idk if I was open previously, but we'll see ..I really enjoyed today's training session, even though it was very triceps heavy and my triceps hurt now. I'm really.trying not to re injure my wrist, which would suck hard. I'm not placing it in any position that I know would hurt. I tried some new exercises and felt a bit stupid but that was fine. Still pretty sore in general. I'm done with 80 percent of leadership work and I had a meeting with Dr mina where I showed her my progress on the site designs, and I made even more progress that I'm proud of, I'm learning more and more stuff with Figma, kinda outta necessity, good necessity, components are important!!..Right now, the plan is to do discrete structures homework, and hopefully finish leadership paper

    Entry: 10 days baby! I am so, SO SORE, and it did not snow here :(, this was a busy but productive day so I would consider it a win, all things considered, I suppose this is probably how the rest of the semester will go, even though it slightly worries me. I sent Dr mina my drafts of the design and she liked them! Yayy, I'm also really proud of them, especially in the time period, the draft they gave was amazingly helpful in having a starting point, without it I would be a fish bobbing in the water trying to find a good design scheme 🥺🥹, inspiration ftw. ..That's how I started my.day tho, working on the designs, and I did a teeeensy bit towards the end of the day, but I have about 3 pages left, which I will be working on tomorrow morning so I can show dr mina during our meeting at 3 30, which I forgot we had seed 😭😭, I'll prolly have to tell Chris. Instil need to talk to Dr bani about the CNXNS thing.....From that tho, I started reading the digital logic circuits textbook and the stuff with binary and it was aight I guess, I definitely need the practice. Went to school, discrete class was fine, I asked a question I would admit was kinda obvious and my brother was laughing at it, not very quietly, and I could see the pity in Ben's eyes and they both kinda messed me up, not significantly, but brought back old emotions I would rather very much rather leave behind....Game design class was fine, kinda boring, I'm loving os class and learning new stuff,and reinforcing old stuff, like I learned of the stty command, then I went to the library and did more reading for dlc, went to os class late lol, by a few mins so not horrible, then went to tdr and had some bomb food. We have class at 11 tomorrow, and funny how 11 is becoming an early time to go to campus lol. I did also do my leadership chapter 1 reading, so hoping to finish chap 10 tomorrow, along with hoping that there aren't too many changes with the Ibt 🥺🥺, I didn't know I was taking 18 creds too, so rip me, we will see how it goes tho, God is my strength 🥹, I'll be getting started on dlc homework tomorrow as well

    Entry: Ignoring the fact that I just spent the past 15 mins being a bum on YouTube, today was super productive, for me that is, I was able to get started on the design for legalmeasure, and we have class at 1 tomorrow so I have more than enough time to work on it. I'm planning on sending a draft to Dr mina tomorrow. ..Then from there, I went to class, Dr Pauliks class seems really fun, I'm gonna do the readings, but I think it'll be after I send dr mina the link, cause LM is more of a priority as of now, I also have a leadership reading to do, I was able to set up file transfer using SCP for qemu tho, so yay. Set up a call with Molly, my mentor and Tehani and Shivani, which, sweet, worked out, wasn't an amazing workout, I'm VERY much sore and there's an insane amount of volume that I don't think I can handle so I'll be cutting down sets. Noble was also there, and the dudes name is Steven!!! The dude I met around when I met Joseph - Messina, or at least I think it's Steven, everyone in seed essentially plus Cs students are in the class so it is going to be chaotic, I'll also be doing lab. ..Lol I just realized two professors today made a comment and my brother being in my class, and Dr Daimi seems okay, a bit run of the mill boring professor, so I think project management will be my least favorite. Fisher and Caleb are in my leadership class, which is nice cause I've kinda wanted to talk to Fisher for a while, he said trayvin left, and my interaction with him was kinda awkward, but whatever 😔. All in all I think I like operating systems class best, dlc is hopefully up there, along with discrete structures. I'm hoping to get good at low level systems and I'm gonna try to hold myself to it over the rest of the semester!..Oh oh we also had Cru, and it was nice, leadership class was cool, and as soon as I entered the library, I saw Irene who talked to me about helping her send what we talked about in the class cause she had a game, and I 100 percent wouldn't have seen the message if I didn't see her. It rained all day today and is supposed to snow all day tomorrow so I can hear the wind! I'm really looking forward to the snow

    Entry: Back in the gym! And back on campus, we went on campus at like 12, which was relatively early, but I enjoyed the early time, so I went to the library and just luckily saw Irene who messaged me about taking the leadership course with her and if I could take notes for her cause she had a game - she sent me a message on IG that I very much wouldn't have seen. But I'm kinda happy that she recognized me out of everyone else taking that class? Even though it's at the different section 🥹..Then we had discrete structures which was good, the class doesn't seem necessarily easy, but I think I will enjoy the class. Then game design, the Prof and his TA are flipping powerlifters and the Prof is a national record holder or something 🥹. The class looks fun tho! I'm brainstorming ideas for the games we have to play. Then I had the meeting with Karen, John and Dr mina, and the foapa section said undefined and I wanna cry 😂😭, then she wants me to have a mockup by the end of the week so I know what I'll be spending my time doing tomorrow ;-;. ..Then Shivani emailed about setting up a meeting, and I emailed my mentor, and I'm very much on the verge of dropping out of CNXNS, so I think I'll email Dr bani Taan tomorrow. I'm absolutely hyped for operating systems, dasgupta uses mint! ..I'm slightly worried about the designing UI, but there's already something go based off on, so I think I shoulddd be fine? the deadline will do me good ..I also worked out and I kinda like the new program, except my elbows are still very much not ready 🥹🥹, I mistakenly kept over extending it yesterday to the point that it was hurting, thinking I'll reach a point where I can just pop it. My biceps were really pumped tho, and I like the feeling of pullovers..There's gonna be a snow storm hopefully tomorrow! I also used boostcamp to track my workout but it's kinda trashy so I'm going back to hevy. This is very disorganized but I'm very tired so goodnight. Tomorrow imma start with the design for legalmeasure. Wow I hope they can pay me with tuition remission 🥺🥹, if not, I'll get through it and God will provide more opportunities in due time - deep breaths. Then I'll start the DLC reading, I really wanna get good at low level stuff, andther  I gotta start small, I hope the stuff is interesting or st least captivating. Operating systems seems very captivating so far

    Entry: Ready for the first day of school ":D!..We already have some assignments, and I first got overwhelmed by leadership class but I took notes of all the essential assignments and stuff, removing the fluff from the syllabus, and I think it will be manageable, I'm still maybe going to have my meeting with Dr mina x Co today? I'll prolly have to send her a message. DLC already has its assignment, cool, it's not due for about a week tho, anyways, let's get this bread..Edit..I just wanna set the precedent that I wanna work hard this semester, like actually challenge myself, I kinda sailed by most of the past semesters, but I really wanna get sth out of this one, ofc I will, but like, meaningful things, and actually be interestef in what I'm learning

    Entry: Back into a week streak! Let's keep this going. It hasn't been on my mind much really, except watching halsins romance scene didn't do me any good lol. I bummed out hard today, like HARD. Played BG3 for a goood amount of time, then watched the Simpsons, and that was about it. I'm about to reach act 3 in BG3 and I'm pretty excited, feels like another adventure, the road to baldurs gate...I downloaded boost camp and natural hypertrophy has a program there that I think Imma follow. Also watched a bit of schitts creek, then spent way too long on reddit, and prolly about to head back there. I did look at the class syllabuses and my first class is at 1 tomorrow, looking forward to not having to be on campus early :D and oh snap - I just sent a reminder for the maybe meeting with dr mina and the dean for tomorrow. And oh snap I gotta email my mentor ;-;..but yeah I'm looking forward to doing lat pullovers

    Entry: I think my sleep is on less of a downward slope, I didn't do any coding today, didn't really think much of it. I went to campus today! And it felt like really not a lot of time had passed. I also brought the face project with me and it worked flawlessly. Ricardo, Al harith, Ben and Andre were there. Also met a dude called Tim I believe, and we talked about cultures and Spain - his parents are from Nicaragua, he's civil but took a gap year for 2 semesters. ..I had to lead a bunchs.highschool students , and had veryyyy little to eat today, two slices of pizza and dinner 😭 it snowed a little today and the snowflakes lokked perfect, like proper shaped snowflake ❄️. I'm still not really ready to go to school, but we gotta do what we gotta do, I get to work out, and enjoy tdr food..I played a lotta BG3, just mostly kinda getting side tracked here and there,.I'm going to the adamantine forge, then going to shadow fell, I already finished mountain pass. Oh I also had s call with Dan, and randomly came across some dude who works in iot and has worked with oee...Tomorrow is my last day of freedom :*)

    Entry: Another typical day, as far as typical goes. My throat just when I speak, so not a good start to having to talk a bunch tomorrow I assume. Speaking of tomorrow, I'm not necessarily worried about it, I've had like 2 moments of, UGH, but they went pretty quickly ..I was arguing with my younger brother about the YouTuber julienhimself, the weird self help guy, and he makes. My head hurt xD..I contributed more to visio today, played a lotta BG3 and I'm finally at level 8. I went through moonrise and I'm pretty happy with how things are going, I've gotten strong enough to crush the people at the gate, and I've found a buncha new places. I gotta get up early tomorrow so imma head out, nothing specific stood out today, which honestly I'm very much fine with..Can't wait to get back to the gym, and I also finished peacemaker

My sleep feels like it's still going down the crapper and I have to be ultra conscious of what's going on with my jaw ;-;. I got more experience with docker today and docker compose, and learned more about apt - the package manager. ..Also made pizza and my ground beef game is getting on point...Oh! I found out that Mitsuki was the one that sang one of the songs played in adventure time, crazy!..I stayed up for like, 2 hours last night cause I couldn't fall back asleep but I essentially made my own dream, which was kinda nice

Then I started to feel more excited lol

    Entry: I don't have the mood for overwhelmed, just the activity, but I'm feeling overwhelmed right now! And nothing has even started, I might just need to re adjust to the flow, but dr mina sent me a message about meeting with the dean, I assume the dean of the law college, and the "client", so they're going to ask me about my preparedness and stuff like that, they're prolly gonna ask me what I understand of the project, and legal documents, and I'm still unsure of how everything is going to work..I also hope they don't talk about tuition remission, or I do, but I hope it's in the context of - we have already settled the tuition remission, etc etc. Right now she said they are bringing in a developer from Michigan to get the ball rolling, so I wouldn't be working alone, which also worries me because they might be using a technology I'm not really familiar with, and they want to get the ball rolling relatively quickly, which is another thing that slightly worries me, and Dr mina was like will I be able to get a working demo by early February, a first draft, and I'm like dang that's like 3 weeks, at best. And I'm definitely gonna be having to do stuff for Dr Qian, and I'm not really ready for classes and the kinda abrupt switch from nothing important to do to many important things to do is overwhelming me. I know at the end of the day, I'll be fine, gotta keep pushing forward

    Entry: I'm still hype, tomorrow I'm gonna learn more about docker compose and more of the backend course, we are learning about osi layers now, rn I understand the application layer - the data requests. The presentation layer, which afaik talks about the presentation of the data, serializing and deserializing the data. ..Then there's the session layer which is about setting up the TCp connection, then there's the network, data link physical and one more I'm most likely forgetting but whatever, it's all making more sense now...Oh! Another great news, Dr Qian is PREPAYING me, so I get like 2900, and I can use dr hills remaining money so my parents dont have to pay for this semester either, sick..Dsngit I was gonna mention something, oh! Dr hill reached out about the frc kick off thingy, and I think ill bring the face project,Dr bani Taan would probably like me to bring it, so I'll present that, other people would be there too, which is cool. I'm def not ready for the break to be over lol, but a lotta my classes are relatively late, which I'm happy about

    Entry: I'm learning so flipping much!! Specifically with using docker, but also with helping contribute to visio. I'm definitely dedicating my time to visio as it's an actual project! And not repetitive, I'm learning pise's way of structuring the code with handlers, which I might be using over time, it makes sense ,like I could have an auth handler struct that will have all the methods related to auth, and I can pass the information all the auth will need, like the auth store, etc. I've done sth similar before, but nothing to this scale, but I'm excited, a random person contributed and we are EXCITED. I'm learning docker and images and pulling images and them dunning in containers and I'm feeling my brain absorb all the information ..Also learning about being able to connect to the a docker shell, not having to install run stuff like postgres locally, but on a docker container. The learning is real :D

    Entry: It's almost 12 and I'm very tired and BG3 makes me wanna cry xD, I did shadow fell before moonrise and it turned out to be a terrible decision 😭, I started the day productive tho, did some coding, pulled visio, got the cookies working, well pise got the cookies working, we essentially texted all day. ..Dood my sleep has been suffering lately, I'd wake up in the middle of the night and overthink my dad's breathing patterns cause maybe he has sleep apnea? It is truly worrying to me, and keeps me up, and as much as I don't want it to, it does, and my entry from a few days ago keeps nagging at me, itching at my head. ..I'm gonna try to stop thinking about it, I got nock from meta quest!and I can see it being really fun. Tomorrow I'm gonna do some more coding, I learned about the sidecar pattern, and I even started the basics of making my own Firefox extension. Rn I have to work on logging in functionality, my task on visio, I learned about .env.example, air, and using make files, docker is definifely my next go. ..I sent Emmanuel an invite for the turn up LinkedIn, snd there's the visit day on the 6th, which, welp..I essentially finished adventure time distant lands and I really enjoyed seeing the characters again

Then I stumbled on a. Picture she showed me and it was of vicsum students and I was like wow! I know them! Then she' started showing me more and I was looking up the pictures from mopes brother, adeniyi, then myself, and there was a picture of a meeting and the Jeremiah dude from udm was there as well! ..Then I woke up

    Entry: New mood icons! I am quite hungry but it's already quite late ;-;. It's still very much true that how I end my day usually affects how I see the rest of the day. Today was pretty mundane, as far as mundane goes, I started the day with the backend course and learned about multiplexing, http 1, 1.1 and 2 differences, stateful vs stateless, new knowledge acquired in general, then I played BG3 for about 3 hours and got semi overwhelmed ..I got the vault elders hair in sky! And helped some moths, my younger brother is bargaining with my mum about getting a new phone and it's kinda funny. From that I played some VR and beat saber, sidenote, I didn't eat a lot today, I had like, a bar of chocolate , a small donut, and essentially the same thing I ate for dinner yesterday. I'm not necessarily focused on losing weight, but i do wanna trim some off, and ik that won't really be feasible over the course of one week, so maybe I'm just trying to prep myself to reduce my intake. ..Then for the end of the day that I was talking about, I decided to keep working on gren and I was making semi good progress I guess, I'm not 100 percent sure how I'll be implementing session invalidation and the cookies weren't working, which were, and are still annoying me. maybe tomorrow I'll make a quick server to test it out. At least I'm finding myself understanding more and more of go since the go course, so that's a plus. Also more of understanding relating networking terms. ..I also worked on turnup and sent my demos, didn't wish lashonda a happy new year even though I really want to..On the bright side, I got nock on VR..Also Andre broke his phone

Also since I'm not really about new yesr resolutions, I still have some broad goals, like getting bigger and stronger, getting better at coding and going more in depth into different topics, touch some AI and touch some grass. Most of my goals are technical or learning based, maybe something artsy will come along the way..First dream; Richards was getting married during finals week, I stopped by the seed room to see him and we started walking to the architectural building .Last dream was Alexis from the children development lab driving us to school, but not all the way there so we had to walk a bit, qnd we came across Andre

    Entry: Pretty standard day, didn't play much bg3, started work on gren and made okay progress, could def have done more, and could def have done less. I don't really have much to say today, this will be a short one ..I watched dune, didn't like it, and joker, liked it. Also had fun in cards and tankards..It would be pretty dodgy of me to admit that I wasn't very much terrified of death, but not my dad's, just the possibility of my dad's, and writing that feels stupid but just the thought scares me. He had been coughing this morning and my mind was going to strange places that I very much dislike. I'm not going to dwell more on the topic

Then I went to campus.and met Christian, Hadassah and some other people, then the first part of the game started which was mostly individual, the test I think and I need elieve I got an 8, then there was the competition, oh Andre was there too but he left, oh Ethan was my teammate! We wanted to do sth unique but I cant remember what, then we settled on a guessing game and wanted to start planning with excalidraw but the other team said we were cheating and I woke up

Still playing baldurs, and I'm still getting such mixed emotions, sometimes I'm hyped other times I don't wanna touch it, it's weird, maybe it's cause I feel overwhelmed now? Idk man..Honestly I had to force myself to get some work done today, mostly cause of the desire to bum around and game, even in VR. Also random note, my dad has been coughing which is slightly worrying to me, idk it's weird but I thought I'd mention it here for the sake of giving my thoughts a place to breathe. ..I worked on the resume changes, changes to turnup, some of the go course, some of the backend course, not a lot of either, and then the rest of the day just kinda went by. I'm sure I'm gonna miss it once break comes along. Anyways I should be heading to bed, I'll catch you around

I'm planning on trying lucid dreaming again, I've been on and off and it bums me out, I really really want to master it..In other news, or same news before the side note, today was mostly gaming with some learning sprinkled here and there, might focus more on the learning tomorrow. Also got on a call with Oriekaose and he told me his wearable idea and the group he's putting together to work on it

    Entry: Okay so I had two dreams, and I've been having critical thinking moments in my dreams, but they don't feel the same as lucid dreaming, so maybe it'd s step in the right direction? The first one was about bombs being dropped everywhere, which I think was because of leave the world behind, and me trying to think about the best place to hide. The next one was in dr pickells class,but not really. We had to make ..Side note while I'm trying to remember what we were making, mofi from mind builders was there and talking a lot about underwear lol, dangit I don't remember what we had to make but it was on paper and I was drawing stuff, we had to show it to him for approval so I showed it to him and he flipped the next page and it was open, and before he commented, my brain always knew that he was gonna say make it more consistent with pens or papers, so idk how thinking works in dreams, but I'm kinda hype to learn more...Also in the first one, there was someone who got shipped away in a box into a different place

    Entry: Played a buncha baldurs today and talked a bunch with Andre about it. Tried watching the videos that Dr nafea sent ...finally, and I've come to the realization that I already knew the answers. I don't like reading research papers and the math behind ml doesn't appeal to me, it looks, and is confusing, and that's part of it, but there's also really not a part of me that wants to go out of my way to learn the math like I would with more complicated technologies. You can't teach passion as Dr nafea said, and I'm sure he won't fault me if I was like I don't wanna do it anymore ..Dangit I gotta redo my resume according to Molly's feedback, but anyways, that was a side track, but yeah I just started the backend course as well and already learning stuff, like what polling is, and I'm hyped for learning more, even if I'm sure it's gonna get complicated fast. I'm still doing the go course and about 70 percent of the way there..Side note, in bg3, I experienced the weave with Gale and it felt great! That's a weird sentence, but you get my sentiment,...Didn't workout today, but imma change that tomorrow

    Entry: Merry Christmas!! Today was, chill, In a calm sort of way. I might do my yearly recapped today. We'll see. Merry Christmas, another year almost gone. We got 50 dollsrs! And my mum made a buncha food for her work party, we just chilled and I watched half a movie, some schitts creek, beat the freaking goblins in bg3, also had a dream about bg3, plus some other weirdness that I am NOT going to talk about, future me, that's your problem not remembering loll. Also played a buncha cards and tankards and a lil bit of beat saber. My mum made moin moin too if I hadn't mentioned that before...I'm definitely putting on some weight, idk I feel obligated to mention that? It's no longer that big an aspect of my life, but part of me has been consciously watching what I eat, which I guess makes sense. Lemme give a quick read of my year, I should organize it by months >:)..Well first lemme remember all the things that stood out, omg was the sky Aurora concert this year?? The biggest parts of this year has definitely been Cru related, fall getaway! I'm so happy I decided to go,plus action group and going to Andy's house and the movie night right after the thingy with Dr Hill. I worked on the reimbursement project with the duck and it has gotten amazing feedback so far! I went on a 50 days streak, and even though I am struggling to recreate it, I know it's within me! ..I started hanging out more in the seed room over the last few school year weeks and found out that I really really enjoy their company, and that I'm more of an extrovert than I thought I'd be. I also realized, like, 20 minutes ago lol, that I might be ready for a relationship? Idk I was talking with Josephene, and I always feel weird talking with her cause of Andre- I don't want it to seem like I'm talking with her behind his back, or that I'm flirting with her (I'm not), but it still feels like a crime, then it hit me that I think I'd really enjoy the ( I just texted nyny and Jared merry Christmas, also texted Kasheem and Christian, also Adrian from sunny side Vue dmed me but he's yet to respond!!!..Okay what else, my amazingly painful internship experience. That sounded ungrateful, it wasn't painful, sometimes, that one fly could go bite it, but it was nice experience, it was cool, going there every morning, then the seed kids showed up, then it became a bit less fun, but also sometimes still fun, it was weird, that was a weird time, I was very much not social then, very very much not social loll, I think, around the right people, honestly I kinda know more than I think, but I'm a lot more social around the right people than not the right people...I didn't play sky as much this year, but I still enjoy it's moments, I'm loving the aviary village, and hype for two embers. I'm listening to a sit by the water and it takes me back to the Godfrey semester, omg that was this year?? Where I remember struggling with knowing my place - mainly because of the journal here, and it takes me back to being in the library and having nothing to do but design apps. ..Speaking of tech, I think I learned a heck ton this year, from golang to how the backend fits into everything to getting better at express and node to hosting. Like I remember looking at talk between pise and mantas and bring confused about the scary backend world, now I'm glad I can contribute to some of that, and even make my own magic. Also learned some more side skills like, idk, I can't even say conflict resolution, some of my relationships definitely weakened this semester, especially with Ben. It's something I don't think I've really dealt with before. Omg should I text giraffe merry Christmas??, I'm gonna do it ..I DID IT!!! IM ON A ROLL OF IMPULSIVE DECISIONS WOO. Honestly it has been something I've really wanted to do, and I still truly do miss savvy. ..Okay I'm trying to think of other new experiences, oh yeah, I TURNED 18!! I'm now an adult, OH, AND I CAN DRIVE NOW! even though my turns are wonky it doesn't matter! I should also start planning on opening an account, but like, still, look at me growing up! I hit 295 on bench, even might've been able to go for a solid 315. Didn't go for prs on squats, but I got good numbers, and im happy with my physique! Content, eh, idk if I'll be truly content, wll, I'll say I'm at a point where sometimes I don't like my muscles, other times I like that, but I know I won't be really really me without them? ..I remember an entry a while back about being defined by my muscle, and I've kinda accepted that as long as I have muscles, there is gonna be some baggage, honestly mostly good baggage, I sound like a bratty teen lol, essentially I made my muscles and my muscles have shaped some aspects of my personality and how I see myself and how others see me. I'm happy with that conclusion. ..I helped out at a hackathon and a buncha JOURNi YTEs, and, omg the relief, the reliefffff, the YAC isn't a thing anymore, ugh y asssss. I found amazing musicians over the year, and refound some like aurora. Sam's with TV shows like invincible. I got a pixel 6 pro, the phone I said I was gonna get a long while back didn't I...Dude a memory just came back and I have to write it. It still relates with the phone, it reminds me of when I had the Samsung S8 pamphlet, and it meant a lot to me, and then I had given it to this teacher for her to fan herself? I'm not 309 percent sure on the details lol, but I know if happened! ..I also remember the field trip for the, idk if it was spelling bee or some other kind of competition where we hit someone crossing the road, well not we, we, the bus driver but you get the point. Wow my headphones were like 10cm away from falling into the terlet...Ok so I have my internship, fall getaway, working on three projects at the same time. I know part of me is looking at FG with rose tinted glasses, but wow, it was so freeing. Oh! Was it this year we did the NCAA cyber games, I can't even tell anymore xD..I got decently good at beat saber and chess, tried some new recipes, the hand cherry pie being hands down the absolute best! I didn't read as many books as before, or use my kindle nearly as much, I think I'll try to change that. Got new glasses and got slightly addicted to smoothie..Note - I got annoyed thinking about the - a man deposited 50 dollars in the bank, why is there an extra 1, I was searching through my gallery lol...I'll read back past my past posts and add anything I missed. I think my main realization about myself is that, I think people change, and I change, and passions change, and I usually feel better when surrounded with people of faith..Edit ..In relation to the pic I added, heck yeah Ara! You got some experience with blender and three J's, along with Matlab and Gee. Even though I might forget these skills, I know that I have been able to learn them to a respectable point before, respectable by my standards, and I can do it again! It's getting really late so off to bed for me ,;(

I have unresolved business but we'll see ..Also didn't drive today..Edit; yeah removed the streak,

    Entry: Omg I almost forgot about my dreams but they were hilarious. The first one, I was in school and just got out of one class, then Andre and I went to tdr, but we realized we still had Mr pickell so we had to rush out, but then we were in central and Kenyae - Dr pickell called him about going to class, entered this stairway with blades around the door, so I turned around and used another staircase, and I entered class immediately Dr pickell left, but I also didn't have any shirts or trousers, then Ben kept looking at me as I was changing xD. Actually I think in the same dream, there was a good looking girl in the front and I was answering questions in class, do after she came up to me and asked if we wanted to try dating, but I was like, I'd rather get to know you better first, and Ben was there in the middle of the two of us and even my dream self could feel my pettiness ..Then my last dream, I was in my mum's car preparing to go somewhere, but the brakes weren't done properly or sth so the car kept moving backwards, then I had to park if farther on the other side of the road. Since it was raining, I thought it meant sth had happened in the apt so I went inside and it was all dark and water was leaking everywhere from the roof. Then I entered the house and the roof was tearing apart, then one big blob of nylon fell and more water spilled. then I told my mum about the car and she was like okay, which I wasn't expecting lol ..Maybe my dream was just a long drawn out way of playing with my fear of driving, or car accidents. There is a big chance I'll be driving tomorrow tho, to get water, so there's that, I haven't driven in two weeks, I'm still gonna put it out of my mind

    Entry: I'm giving myself the pleasure of the elusive hat trick, 3 greats in one day! Today was, amazing, in a toned down inside chilling kinda way. I started off tackling the face project again, realizing that I was focused on the semi incorrect approach and getting the robot running, bonus points for confirming my suspicions about the I2C port being the same for the two eyes, even more bonus points for emailing Dr bani Taan with a video of it. ..I then kept working on leave a mark and got to the point where screens are connected and tomorrow I'm working on the UI and making more quality of life features. ..Then doing more of the go course and finally fully cemented genetics, the syntax is kinda elusive and I don't think I'll be using it anytime soon, but the concept is there, which I am more than happy with. Also got a new course that is looking to be good, going into very great depths on networking and computers, which I am here for...Then.ended the day with bandit, but with a surprise at the end! I asked for help on the level 22 to 23 and struck a conversation with a dude, who then dmed me, and we got on a call! And I was very much worried that it was a hacking attempt lol, but it wasn't :D. Which was amazing, omg I just remembered Jamal, but he graduated high school and spent a buncha time learning game development, and when he went to college he realized that it was too basic, which I did really feel validated, like, usually I'm not around people who feel the same as me, but life goes on eh. ..My spine still hurts, idk if it's cause I'm on VR for more time than normal. Also I was so close to beating camelias Megalovania.lost with like 5 seconds to go 😭😭..I think the day would've come full circle is I read the case of faith, but I'm planning on integrating that to my morning routine instead of doom scrolling. I still haven't gotten into blender, my days are essentially the go course, which I don't do much in tbh, but now I'm gonna start cause it's heating up, plus working on some form of project, I'm glad that leave a mark is going well, then VR, bandits usually take a good chunk of my time too, time kinda flies by sometimes too, well whatever, as long as I'm having fun, which I am

    Entry: Lol ignore my previous entry, I was up too late yesterday. Daylio wrapped came out today and I wrote, a lot. 100k words. Idk if that's in total, or just for this year, but even then, it's still a ton. I was semi productive today, I'm back into coding into semi new territory and I'm enjoying myself, I wanted to, actually , I'm really curious to try to narrate but I'm very much worried others would hear . I'll just write it and wait to be home alone. ..So I started off working on redoing the picamera stuff and I think I was able to make an inkling of progress, I'm hoping to email dr bani by the end of the week, but I opened my first GitHub issue, not worthy enough for a celebration, but still lol, here's to hoping some kind person responds :*). Then I did some go coursing, I'm officially halfway through and still learned a few new things, like returning a struct also returns, nah I think I learned that yesterday, it doesn't matter! I learned stuff XD and now we are moving into new territory so it should be fun. ..Then I decided to do some work on esmee, pise's project, but it was turning out bad :*). I was making progress, but the code was just looking awful, then we wanted to make our own database but that's way above our pay grade for now, so hopefully I can do some stuff with visio, and I tried to migrate oee to vue 3 but bootstrap still doesn't have it out! ..There's a spot in my spine that's all weird, maybe I've been using VR too much, it's messing with my posture. I'm still really enjoying schitts creek, but I also started Fiona and cake, and I'm enjoying it too, the plot is still building up but I already find some food music tracks. ..The semi highlight of the day is that I started a new project in my to-do about multiple people bein able to draw on the same canvas at the same time, and it seems like it's fixing to be a fun project, I have how I want it to work mapped in my head,.but we'll see

    Entry: I just had a really long talk with Andre and it was really nice, he told me about his bum mum and I told him about me looking about my parents texts. I really enjoyed the convo, idk it felt real, like, vulnerable real, which I enjoyed a lot ☺️. I also had a call with Max I think, the one who did the robot face and it wasn't working so I'm gonna try to rewrite everything from.scratch because f me yay...Did more go course, bandit, and fed learning call today, not a lotta coding,...It's already tomorrow so I'm heading to bed. Also nyny responded :D

    Entry: Rad would be over reaching, but I just texted nyny in an attempt to reach out and I'm feeling really happy with myself, idk if I should call her Franny loll. part of me doesn't understand my own motivations, but in trying to ignore all that lol, the raspberry pi charger came and I'm semi excited and very nervous to test it out tomorrow. ..I also did more stuff on the go course, played a buncha beat saber and swarm and a teensy bit of Les Mills, worked on the changes for the ld ibt which took me longer than I'd like, I didn't get to the bandit challenges, which now I'm kinda bummed about, I was watching a few more scripting videos with bash, tomorrow I'll still start my day with the go course, since most of it RN is just review which is kinda boring ,well, I'm actually gonna start my day off testing the raspberry pi stuff ..Wish me luck, and I hope nyny responds

    Entry: Today was a pretty nice Sunday, I woke up at like 9, slept in late! Played swarm, and it's a pretty fun game, perhaps a bit repetitive. ..It rained most of the day, AND I ENDED UP NOT EVEN DRIVING, cause my dad was using my mum's car, still attended church and was able to pass the bandit challenge and learned more about ssh with public key authentication..I also love love love shows with great character development, I'm really enjoying schitts creek, and even that's why I love shows like adventure time...Rn im listening to the season of little prince theme song and it's so precious, same with the song for the fireworks, wait I gotta do the quests for today. Byee

    Entry: Today was good, chill. Made some progress and was productive, the picamera came and it works!!! Now I wait patiently for the charging thingy, and lets hope for the best shall we. ..Data mining final got graded and I got s 31 which is cool. I also connected logseq with GitHub, and that took way longer than I'd like to admit, and I continued with the bandit challenges. Also finished jjk and i was skipping nobaras backstory and my younger brother showed me a TikTok with someone doing the exact same thing..Wait tho! That wasn't the highlight of my day, I was playing sky, and I lighted this person while doing the tree quest, then I started following them on their candle run and it was so fun. Like we didn't talk, and I enjoyed the strangeness of it all, I just followed them and we had like a mutual connected, except I friended him eventually 😂, well he friended me, then we got to the end of forest and we started chatting and se llama kenshy. ..He or she, in still not sure, speaks Spanish so I had an entire lengthened conversation with them in Spanish, they're from Chile and I did have fun

    Entry: How am I feeling you ask? Relieved, calm, cool, collected. I just went through the sky aviary fireworks show and I really really enjoyed it, the ambience was exactly what I needed, even though it feels me with some Wunderlust. ..I had the meeting with Tehani and Shivani and got some feedback, which I swiftly implemented thank you very much, and I was slash am happy with myself and the time I dedicated to working on it. I also finished the bash shell video and learned a bunchhh, used logseq a bunch too, pise showed me this thingy that I could use to learn more about the terminal and command line and I'm finding it very very helpful. ..I also have not been graded for data mining final, which is weird, but I'm fine with it, it'll get sorted out eventually. I also made a nice, very heart unfriendly lunch, gonna cut down on all the oils. I also did do a VR les Mills workout, which was amazing and tough, but just tough enough. Speaking of VR ,asgards wrath 2 just came out and I am itching to get it, I also played more cards and tankards, and watched a bunch more of schitts creek..Now, I gotta go sleep. Te voglio

    Entry: Wrapping up today pretty balanced, I did well on the finals with a 31.5 over 35, technically over 32, which I am more than aok with, I have  a potentially big opportunity, with the chance of immense growth in my skills, and winter break is coming, tomorrow is essentially my last day of school work. Dsngit I have to ask Dr bani Taan if he knows where I can get an extra raspberry pi cord, honestly I will just buy one myself cause why not...Alright RN I'm really really tired, I'll catch you on the flip side

    Entry: Yooo I'm kinda hyped, I got a 31.5 on the software engineering final, and Dr mina messaged me about a project so I talked with her at the end of class and the project looks cool but complicated!!! Like a shopping system is also part of it 😭,but if I start small, I know I'll be fine, and I prolly won't be working on it all alone, which is very nice. Essentially it's for the legal system and idk how the payment thingy is going to work, seems like a grant so hopefully tuition remission is perfect, but I am looking forward to it. Once I get home, I'm recording the video for Dr mina, sending the email, doing the comp sec final too, def eating something lol, but yeah I'm kinda hype, but I should temper my expectations ik ik

    My mood Unsure
    
    Entry: Worrying is so, tedious, like, unnecessarily tedious. I'm even catching myself getting caught up in the why of it all. I'm not full on panicking rn, but I have to get a minimum of 75 percent I believe, on the stats final to get an a, and it's not that tough to do so. The lowest I've gotten on an exam is a 94. So number 1, the danger doesn't match the reaction, or vice versa. Two, I'd have to fail to get an A-, so that's another thing. I've gotten B's in easier classes before. ..For software engineering, I also feel decently prepared, and today is technically my last day of finals, so I'm not sure why I still have nagging feelings, except that's not true and I am sure. I can't not stress about things that are important to me I guess, same thing with fear. Right now it's definitely being managed, so I'm not that worked up about it, but it's still there, so I think I just have to accept the apprehension as a sign that I am doing something I care about, or at.least is important to me, even if it's for the wrong reasons

Also did more jjk watching , it's way too late and I'm headed to bed, but did stats final and some studying, bought go course and started drafting my schedule for the break. I'm also gonna be learning about scripting :D..Also Thomas offered to send my resume to Snapchat and I wish I could say yes UHH but I gotta wait and chill

    Entry: I had fun, a lot of fun actually. I went to campus to workout and for recitation, which I didn't actually go to, but I hung out at the seed room. Rn I'm watching the blue eyed samurai and it's actually really interesting. I wrote it off too quickly 😭😭. ..But yeah I hung out at the seed room and essentially studied for software engineering. I'm def not coming on campus tomorrow tho, too much work. Jelina I think is her name was recording a video for her future kids and it was pretty funny but it was also pretty smart. So far a lot of my entries have been personal but that doesn't give room for other people, or like for me to show my interactions with other people if that makes sense. I'm not that free to do sth like that like jelina does, but it's sth to think about..Also oleander by mother mother is stuck in my head, and I'm starting the plan for my schedule tomorrow..At the fitness center JP was also there with his gf and he struck up a convo with me as I was unracking and honestly it felt pretty awkward since we don't know each other super well, and his gf joined in, but he talked about reaching my level one day.

    Entry: Pretty nice day, had the same issue with the code and the pain of wasted time ;-;, but there's gonna be a meeting with Max I think, and everything should hopefully work out :*). ..Went on a call with the duck and it was pretty fun. There were some conversations about racism and it was hilarious, we are just essentially teasing Ben. I played a bunch of beat saber and cards and tankards. Beat saber was flipping fun. Tomorrow am I going on campus? I'm gonna flip a coin to decide

Helped Richard at the event, got home and did some work on Emmanuel's app, tomorrow gonna study for software engineering, and that's about it.ethan was playing GTA and it was nice to talk ..Played some cards and tankards today..Also finished adventure time today, and it essentially made me cry, that show was amazing, wow I might rewatch it, it was about half an hour long and my brain is still trying to process it all fully, but I thoroughly enjoyed it

    Entry: Today was great! My dad's pinning ceremony was today, I had a meeting with Molly Laird my mentor from seed, and we had Chinese takeout and now my stomach hurts xD, I played beat saber and cards and tankards, today was the seed party and I got an amazing gift, and I made semi some.progress in the robot project which I'm gonna email Dr bani Taan about tomorrow, and I secured a ride for tomorrow cause my.brother is also going ..So let's start, today started chill, my dad was home and I just went to work on the robot face project, thinking about it kinda bloods my boils cause I feel like I spent a lot of time on it, reinstalling stuff back and forth only to not get it working as I would like, but tis the nature of work, at least I have a plan of emailing Dr bani Taan and seeing the libraries the other SD card used, it'll also be good for documentation. ..Then went to campus late, chilled in the seed room for a bit, I feel like I'm becoming more and more extroverted as I'm enjoying more and more the company of, and hanging around the seed kids, normally I'd spend that time in the library, but I find myself gravitating to the seed room after class, I'm really glad that it became a thing..Okay so from there I had my meeting with Molly and she looked over my resume for me and gave me some good tips so I'll be incorporating those. Dang recently I've been enjoying the company of people and it's affecting my mood positively, whether that be Lukas or the seed kids, is this a new dawn for extrovert Ara lol..Then we had the seed party and there was a mug maker, we played outburst and lost by 1 point lol, I had some very sugary stuff, gonna be burning off the calories during break :*). Then we shared the gifts and I got paired with Andrew! And even though I was expecting some gym related thingy, he got me a really cute plushy named Carlos xD, it's a crab, like the rust crab, along with a really long candy! Which I'm gonna be chomping off piece by piece, it was amazing. I gave Al harith my gift and I think he really liked it, there were some other sick gifts like a scarf, a book, an abacus lol,but I couldn't stick around for the giving of gifts to Dr Hill and Chris, which I wish I could've :*(...I'm currently lying in bed with Carlos in my arms and the warmth and softness feels kinda nice loll. ..From there we went home to get ready for senior pinning, and I really enjoyed it, cause I can imagine the POV of my dad ever so slightly, that this is going to be a core memory for him, and it's possible to still gain new experiences like that as we get holder, which kinda soothes me as you know I've been dealing with worries about stagnation of experiences and wonder with age, things like that, and I'm just processing that it kinda restored my faith in that aspect of how time flows. ..Then we got takeout and arrived just as the door dash dude arrived. Oh uncle Ben and aunty Pat were there too, and Mr tosin. From there I got home, thank God, and during the trip, I kept feeling apprehensive of driving, and the finality of accidents if that makes sense, like idk I feel like I'm starting to develop, not a hatred, but something close to it, even though thank God nothing has ever happened to cause that reaction in me. It's weird ..Anyways, then I played beat saber and some games of cards and tankards, then I found another came called Mecha something, and it looks really fun, so I'll give it more of a try. Now in off to bed cause I gotta be up early tomorrow, ciao!

    Entry: I'm a bum, today was an okay day, pretty busy, I kinda, not bonded, but spent the most time I'vespent with Lukas, and I played ping pong and lost and sweated a lot but it was still cool to hang out with him, like discovering a new area of a video game, ugh I'm tired and I don't like that analogy lol..And I just spent the last like.hour on reddit, at least I don't have to be up early tomorrow

    Entry: Today was honestly a very fun day, it puttered out at the end, but it was all in all an amazing day. I don't know if I mentioned already but beat saber released their next OST. ..And unrelated note, Ugh I gotta start doing more cardio!!! 😭, my heart needs it. ..Back to today, it was one of my favorite day of the month, and maybe the past few months, and maybe going down as a memorable one. I spent essentially the entire day in the seed room. I first started with debugging the robot face and I made some amazing progress, used another SD card and re did raspberry pi os and sent the files over, now I just gotta start installing the packages. ..From there, went to campus, went to campus and Dr Zhong and stopped by the seed room, so I chilled there for a while, a flipping long while lol, OH FIRST, I WAS ABLE TO DO AOC DAY 3, LIKE YASSS, I was so surprised that it worked, ugh I should'nt have eaten so close to bed time, but essentially I was there for a long while, then took a detour for destress fest where we played those bouncy soccer thinfys and we were just hitting each other and Joe was like I hit like a truck xD, and I really did like how it felt, pushing Al felt like ragdolling him xD. Then we played some Roblox, a scary game, but my computer was messing up so we couldn't finish. Then we were just watching eating videos. ..Oh I also got Al harith the bag that I'll be wrapping my gift in. Then I also played around with the sky nine colored deer season! And I'm loving the vibe and colors of the new area, dang I gotta finish the quests, but then we had the computer security presentation. ..Finally, Joe also left and I dimmed the lights and just chilled watching the new Simpsons episodes, I kinda liked the second to last latest one. It's getting really late tho, so I gtg,..Ricardo and Al harith were also worrying about their test and I hope I was able to help them chill a bit

The seed meeting is on Friday and I still have to wrap al hariths gift, maybe I'll stop by the library tomorrow to see if I can buy wrappings there. ..I texted Thomas, the dude from Snapchat, and that's about it from me.

Also GTA 6s trailer came out! And I started baldurs gate and it looks so good but it's gonna go take a while for me to fully get into it. My workout was nice. I was also pretty productive, met with Ahlam with Ben, did data mining presentation and computer security presentation, did office hours and helped explain the concept to Joe and Nate, I still don't know his name DANGIT, I'm sure it's Nate. Then I helped Andrew - pre calc Andrew, with his work for maple, which was great...I begsn to feel more and more like that's my God given talent, essentially being able to understand code and help debug, lol it sounds less cool when I write it, but I don't hate the thought. Also my dad is finally done with schooling, apart from the NCLEX exam, and I'm super happy for him, ready for his graduation, and hopefully God willing things start looking up! ..I'm going to get my desires under control and maintain them in a choke hold. Rn im headig to bed in an effort to slowly alter my sleep schedule to move it earlier. I didn't get around to aoc today 😭, I've been racking my brain thinkinngof how to do day 2. Tomorrow I'm gonna email Shivani and Tehani cause I believe I'm done with their changes, and that should be it..Oh snap I don't have a section telling the user they have bias towards x or y, gonna add that. But in general yeah I'm done...Tomorrow there's a yoga on the court thing and I'm planning on going..Yoo I almost forgot to say , I found vicsums Instagram page and they had videos with a buncha people in my class and it was kinda cool seeing all of them again, and kinda how different they'd been, and idk I'm beginning to appreciate others talents now, like andres public speaking, which kinda awakened in me during the hackathon, and Ben's organizational skills, which are still awakening in me but I can recognize it, and like semilogos ability to articulate. I'd say good times, but the memories are kinda slipping, and it does truly bother me cause I wonder the kinds of things that just linger in my head waiting to be reignited

    Entry: Busy! But productive day, very productive, got some work done for some classes, did my dad's test that took like 4 hours ;-;, went driving with my mum to where she works and it was kinda awkward sometimes but only if I dwelled too much on it. I saw where she worked and the people she worked with and there was this dude screaming in some dark room and it was so unsettling 🥹😂, but I think I managed to play it off cool. ..Rn it's late but I'm clearing my windows to try to get it in tiptop shape again so maybe I can do some gaming, back to where my mum works, it's in river rouge and the people there are essentially special needs and it was so strange cause I don't remember the last time I've been in close.prozimity with one, or even touched one, and I'm kinda curious as to how they perceive the world, whether they have thoughts like I do but just can't act on it, idk, it would make a very interesting case study to look into their minds..I didn't get a chance to play any games today, which is a bummer, maybe tomorrow, I'm also planning on clearing out windows even more. I was able to get as much stats homework as I'm planning to get done finished, OH AND we went to online church today lol, the pastor is an old friend of my mum's and it was a very small sermon and I had a lot of mixed feelings but I didn't hate it..I started watching the last exile and it is pretty interesting. I'm already kinda missing action group, but I'm semi ghosting emmanuel - oriekaose's friend, but not anymore cause I just replied to him, booyah. Also replied to ahlam, and now I'm just ghosting alegs lol

I met some people from lsst year and some other new people which was cool ..I don't have a lot more to say honestly. Kinda boring summary to a long days work, I've been ignoring some people too which does weigh on me, tomorrow I'm planning on finishing the stats hw, finishing my dad's HW, then sone other stuff, goodnight..Oh also finished AOC day 2

    Entry: HAPPY NEW MONTH! Time to try something new, I'm gonna be adding on to here everytime i commit a sin ..- lustful thoughts.- striking and letting folly thrive - weirdly worded.- lustful thought.- more lustful thoughts .- badmouthing some random dude my younger brother was watching on YouTube who was making some random guy scream to release his inner self or sth..I definitely had a lot more than these but these were the most apparent, and the lustful thoughts were definitely there lol, but today I was productive and enjoyed it a lot. ..I was originally not going to come on campus, well, I hadn't made my mind yet, but I decided to, semi last minute. Then I regretted it immediately I walked outside lol, it was rainy, I could've been chilling inside. I spent literally 5 minutes in dr zhongs class cause I didn't do the test, my workout was trash, I mainly joked up in the library listening to music, but I got some software engineering work done, dang I gotta make acao flyers..I was semi productive which was nice, then I went to eat tdr, worked out and saw Nate there, I didn't even know he worked out but now I can see it. From then on, I went to the seed room in good time to miss everyone so I was there alone, dimmed down the lights, got on a call with Andre for a while, then just relaxed and it was chill, listening to Olivia Olson, her songs have been stuckkk in ma head!. Then I went home, started stats homework, and we have the hackathon tomorrow and I have no idea what to expect, gonna head to bed now tho, gotta get back on a schedule ..Well, now's the best time than ever to process everything, essentially tensions were high yesterday during the duckateers call to turn in Dr bani Taans paper, and Ben was like he would not want to work on a project like this with us, then we did agree that it was hard coordinating, then he singled me out saying he didn't want to work on a project like this with me, I wasn't particularly offended, but Andre did have my back which did feel really really nice lol, idk, it was weird, I definitely don't wanna start having factions, Andre and Ben's relationship has definitely taken a hit, Ethan and Ben's is still going steady I suppose, mine and Bens has definitely taken a hit and .I think the next step for me is to be able to sure more true emotions, like anger when he tries jumping to conclusions, or calling me lazy, but proverbs wise, it's not wise to give in to wrath, ah that is true, it is better to stay away from conversations that can lead to anger and honestly stress, so yeah what I have so far has been working so might as well keep going. I've essentially ghosted Ahlam, I gotta reply lol..Also my mum made smoothies and they are delish

While, we were able to turn in our data mining paper at the final moments, and I do feel relieved but the battle isn't over yet, there are definitely some thing that I'll have to talk over here to get them off my chest, but I think ill do that tomorrow morning after a good night's rest, and a good read of la biblia, now I gotta go to bed, and relax, and tomorrow have a nice hot cocoa, and I am debating going on campus, but I just might not, it's something tomorrow me will decide. Dude I'm kinda hyped for no reason, I'm having very conflicting emotions, the adrenaline rush of turning the stuff in is something I usually don't feel 😂

    Entry: Today was essentially a day and a half, and ended up being more busy than I thought it was going to be, my legs are so amazingly sore 😭😭, it hurts, but good hurts, honestly today was a really nice day. It started with me working on the raspberry pi but that didn't bear fruits, so I asked the forum but my question hasn't been approved yet apparently ;-;, so imma keep chugging at it, tomorrow, prolly not. ..Then had a call with Dr nafea and Ahlam and it went by pretty quickly, went to school and stats went by quickly, then my group for ethics quickly got together and quickly assembled our presentation and I think we did pretty well, I'm just glad that we are done with it, then I was working on the presentations for computer security, but he postponed it to next week which is sick, then I chilled in the seed room grading peoples stuff, and some people messed up big time and I feel bad for them, especially noshin, like, Rip😭, but it was chill, I was there with Al and Joe and Andreh and some others who went in and out. In general it was chill, I was also watching like food levels type videos, like chef type stuff, then I was starving and stopped by Cru for some amazing food. Then worked a bit on the paper with Ethan, now off to bed...This entry was mostly just a run down of my day, nothing too deep ..Ben and Andre also had a fight..Oh and Spotify wrapped is out!

    Entry: Today was a nice day, pretty long and coldd, which is nice. I'm telling Ethan that he's been appearing in my dream too much, watch me dream about him again tonight loll. I'm super tired and worked on ethics but am yet to grade the students final lab 😭. ..My workout was great, like amazing, but the back of my hammies kinda hurt, and now only shoeless squats for me, they just feel right, idk how to explain it..Alr off to bed, way too late

    Entry: Had action group today and there are definitely some stuff that I'm happy about and some stuff that I'm not. Stuff I'm happy about - there are some things that have stuck with me a lot, like me not being sufficient in myself and God making me sufficient, focusing and looking towards the things of the future, not of the earth, like remembering how temporary everything is. And today about distancing myself from bad media I guess, like, no not even that, specifically watching what I say, I was going to do a challenge of like waiting for like 4 seconds before I say anything, but that might be extreme, but essentially reevaluating the things I say to make it so that I only say wholesome things essentially, like things that wouldn't bring down other people. ..I gotta change my wallpaper to remind me lol, okay I couldn't find any good ones lol, but yeah just watching what I say. Today I definitely had some positive moments tho, in the seed room mostly, I was talking with Evan about stuff like hand feeling cheeks or whether they are being felt by cheeks, and like concentrated pee, and it was weird but fun lol, then he was having a bug with his code and it was acting super strange but we were able to fix it, it was a typing error, and I'm kinda surprised c didnt.throw an error, but the code now works which is sickk. I was also reading Spanish in front of Andreas, and I helped Kyle and Chris learn how to code together, and had a good meeting with Andy, but I got sidetracked! ..The negative, or I guess bad ish part about the action group is that I didn't really walk away with a lasting connection with anyone, which was kinda a bummer, maybe Bryce and Noah, but that's about it, ik it's bad when I feel very awkward taking off my jacked and feeling like I'm showing off of sth, it was very awkward lol, I didn't get to finish my workout cause I had to rush there, but essentially if I met them outside again, like next fall getaway, idk if I'd even be able to sit at their table and converse normally or whether it would just be awkward, I guess there is always a learning phase tho, they have their groups already but I can slowly try to get closer to them, even if there isn't a lot of opportunities to :(...That's all sad and stuff, and ugh kinda piggy backing off my conversation before, it kinda sucks, getting older with new experiences, and I'm not even that old ;-;, theres a ton of stuff im yet to do as well, maybe I'll make a 100 number long bucket list. ..Also had recitation with Ricardo and Nate I believe is his name, and it was chill ..I also ate not a lot, like, I had breakfast, at like 11, then dinner at like 730, and I didn't feel alll that hungry really, I have a headache now tho and I'm sure it's cause of either not enough water, cause I am essentially dehydrated, or just, idk, too much sugar from the donuts lol

    Entry: Something alegs said has been sticking with me today, he was like, Ik I've made it, I'll be happy when Im able to eat cereal with chocolate milk for breakfast, and I could easily do that at TDR every day, and it kinda put things into perspective, like, of course my normal saying, because your situation is bad doesn't make someone else's situation less worse, but it kinda made me grateful for more stuff. ..Like back in Nigeria where we'd have to wake up early on Saturdays to wash the clothes, of where the only food is okra and eba, like yesterday we thought we were gonna be eating okra and i could feel that feeling again, the dread, of being hungry but not wanting to eat what's there and its something I haven't felt in a LONGGGG while, like hedonic adaptation has done a splendid job at making me complacent in terms of TDR food, and that's kinda a bummer, like sth I catch myself being like, this ain't that good, or, not this, to TDR food, and not that it's bad to feel those feelings, but when I essentially get put in my place, it.puts a lotta things into perspective...In happier less existential news, we got our first snow snow of the season, and i didn't truly enjoy it enough, I did play a lot of cards and tankards and I enjoyed that a decent amount, even met a developer and had a one word interaction loll..The duckateers got Ina. Call today and we got a bit of work done, nothing substantial, I was organizing my bookmarks - very random note, and I replied to Dr heather Hill on not being able to do the student presentation, partly cause.lazy partly cause I don't want future me to deal with all that, partly cause I wanna have a winter break project, like building my own full body VR tracking set with slime VR, cause that would be sick, or something software based, I def can't, well, prolly won't be able to finish the react course in that time, don't wanna say can't. Honestly I could, I could try to push my limits to see how much I could learn in a week. Like if the course is 60 hours, if I spent 10 hours on it daily, in one week I could finish it. Is that realistic? Probably not, but the winter break can give me a lot of free time to experiment with myself and try new learning environments. I could even do the same with blender and learn to have hyper focused moments where I get a lot of learning done. I'd be excited to see how it goes. I'm kinda hyped! I should change my mood..Another long form project will be building my own PC, even if there's no space for it for now. Other things I wanna learn are blender, maybe some more in depth Linux and raspberry pi stuff. I finished season 8 of AT and it made me sad 🥹, teary eyed even, it was great...Ethan was in 2 of my dreams tonight and I remember 2 vivisdly, one was with me and Andre getting food at TDR after Mike isratel and lean beef patty teleported into our dimension, or maybe dream me spawned them lol, It was an awkward dinner, then we kept going back for more food and tdr kept getting more and more complicated. ..Then, there was a dream about travelling to another dimension gathering cards, like this big red tower, then after returning, the beings from that tower, wanted the cards or items back

    Entry: I'm kinda ready for break to be over, I played so much cards and tankdards today, my head hurts, I want to buy the kiwi head strap, but I was able to pay off Google domain and google drive extra storage with my dad's card..Watched a bunch more adventure time today, and we didn't go to Dan's house cause of my mum supposedly. I made some cookies! And got compliments on them lol, my mum went to work this morning and it was so nice to have a quiet house for a while. ..My middle and ring finger have been acting tight, like they're about to cramp, I'm definitely over using them ;-;, my shoulders as well haven't gotten to fully recover cause of beat saber, which I slammed today. I'm definitely planning on getting that head strap, that's about all for today, got in a meeting with the duckateers and Ben wanted to show us what he had been working on but it didn't open ig, I'm hoping to get back into the swing of work so back to serious mode tomorrow, gonna make the ibt changes, get some data mining and comp sec work done, etc etc

    Entry: Definitely let everything go, but I'm not all that globbed up about it. I've been watching A TON of adventure time, but I really really loved the first few episodes of season 7, made me sad, and made me think, I'm really.glad I stuck with this show lol, at first I was skeptical, all skepticalities now gone ..Didn't do any work really for data mining or comp sec or soft eng today, and it kinda felt good, being a bum that is, lol, it really did, it was freeing, even though I very much quickly found sth else to occupy my time, watching two videos at the same time, trying to "train" my attention span, which is kinda weird but I am curious if it works...I started today off being a bum, then made breakfast with AT on, played some cards and tankdards till like 12 30, then did the IBT call which lasted for like 15 to 20 mins I think, they were chill with good answers, Shivani is much more welcoming than Tehani, but that's fine lol. I kinda wanna get to know her more cause she looks kind, but that's a convo for another day. ..Then I helped my dad with his work till like, 4, made some lunch, add bumming around in between, learned a teensy bit more about Linux but I don't really have any concrete goals or plans for the break, just wanted to enjoy it. Then played cod with my younger brother which was nice...My relationship with Ben, I keep using the word relationship, but yeah, it's kinda globbed up, idk, I'm beginning to feel distrustful of him, like not being able to believe in him about stuff, and I'm beginning to feel like I used to feel when I used to text with alegs, and it's kinda annoying and draining talking to him now, and I don't want to feel like I'm constantly putting on a farce in front of him and just putting up with his overanalyzing self, but then again, winter break is like 20 ish days long, which is pretty good time for a break. ..I STILL HAVENT EMAILED DR HILL BACK AAA, imma do it tomorrow! Also we might be going to Dan's house tomorrow, woo!

    Entry: Wowee I am tired, spent an hour today trying to order gifts from temu cause I ran out of gift cards 🥹, luckily was able to get it settled. I didn't work on the robot today, oH HAPPY THANKSGIVING. I didn't know today was Thanksgiving lol, I kinda had fun I suppose, Christmas time is now!! ..Essentially I was able to get the gifts I wanted for Al harith, my seed gift partner, then the turkey was delish, it smelled nice in the morning - my dad didn't go to work. Then I tried getting some work done in gee and got essentially the bare minimum, and I didn't even mind. Looks like Ben lied about what was due and it did annoy me a fair bit. But I guess we've just been annoying each other lately and it's not good for our relationship. ..Played some beat saber and it was freaking fun, even though my arms were lagging behind my brain. No beat saber tournament for us :(, it's on December 2nd. I played some cards and tankdards and it was fun as well. I still haven't responded to study of film Dr Hill, I will tomorrow! Also have the ibt meeting tomorrow, and gonna help my dad with some work, and do some mini Linux/Unix learning, I learned about more, less and the pipeline syntax, also !! And I got to customize my Linux mint a bit more. Rn I'm off to bed. ..Cyas..Also not ticking the resist temptation mark because even though I didn't do it, the things I saw kinda messed me up, I've been watching a lot of adventure time lol, season 6 is cool, I finished it. Also downloaded call of duty

Started the day trying to figure out the robotic face but I realized that it wasn't a huge priority as of now, so I started working on some other stuff. Finished Shaylas survey, and finally got to work on the association tests. Hmmm, honestly that's about all the work I did today, no coding specifically, mainly just GEE, and spent way too much time on it;-;, made some spaghetti with spaghetti sauce and it tasted really nice, even though I didn't actually make the spaghetti, or the sauce 🥹. ..Finally using the 3 plus images lol, but! I played sky for a while and it was super nice, finished some quests, helped and got helped in Eden, tomorrow imma try to see what gift cards I have so I can start buying stuff..Also finished captain laser hawk and pise launched visio which I'm yet to try!

    Entry: It rained literally all day today!! And Dr bani Taan gave me the robot face so I had to carry it in the rain lol, winter break has officially started, and I'm kinda glad I get that time away from one person in particular, Ben, Ben is that one person in particular. It's not worth it, nor do I care much for writing much about the matter, my brains mostly focused on other things. I'm so so flipping glad that break is here tho, tomorrow imma work on some data mining, try not to get on any calls lol, try starting up the robot for Dr bani taan, finally proof test the IBT site and make the language changes, and just chill in general. ..I started this show called, general mohawk? Captain Mohawk? Idek but it's pretty good, very short tho. ..Also did a presentation on render, vercel , deploying, even Figma. I hope it was useful to the students, but it was useful for me!..Ugh I gotta start recording my dreams again 😭

Did a bunch a coding today, for data mining, training models isn't that hard, gathering the data is, and I'm kinda happy with what I'm learning, and how it's turning out...We had Dr Zhong s class online today, and had the presentation on Garifuna settlement day and I learned a lot, it was pretty interesting! Video of the pr is in Google photos

Also already stocking up my Amazon cart loll. I'm pretty tired, still happy about the driving license stuff, wish we could have a Cru session cause I do love being able to share stuff like that with others. We have the final action group tho!!

    Entry: I'm definitely very much worried over my driving test, and I think it affected my workout and my sleep to a small degree, my workout was definitely trashed as I didn't get enough sleep - had to wake up early for visit day which went surprisingly well! The students were excited about it and no crashes, which was sickk..I met a dude named Mario k. All I have to say lol, Ben thinks I'm on roids, just leaving that here , but I've been getting so much love from the sky server, and I'm not responding yet till I pass that test! Time seems to be going so slowly, but even then this morning has been so busy, and I have the beat saber tourney tomorrow as well, I'm not even as worried about that as I am over the driving test. The danger definitely DEFINITLEY does not match my fear

    Entry: Didn't even feel slightly tempted today, and honestly I had a lot of fun. I'll start my entry in the morning, so woke up thank God, and read the bible a bit, didn't have breakfast, and did some software engineering work. Then went to campus, data mining class was fine, technical writing was also fine, nothing really stands out, we worked on our website, FRICK I HAVE TO TEXT TRAYVIN, but uh, dang I'll do it tomorrow. Imma just skip to the good part..International night was going on and I didn't expect anyone really to show up, I thought Oriekaose was planning it on his own, so I had to work out and told Ethan to go so that he'd feel supported, it felt so far away when he first sent info about it lol. I guess the weekend rn feels so far away cause that's when my driving test is, it has definitely been occupying my mind a lot more. Not necessarily blatant stress, more like, it's happening, fail or pass it's happening, and rn I'm just thinking that it's best to let God's will be done, but then again idk if im just saying that to cope about the scenario. ..All that is getting side tracked tho, there was food from a bunchaa places with a lottta people, and there were these Irish dancers and it was pretty nice! I felt so medieval, eating as other people danced for our entertainment loll, I really did want to get into it, they were tap dancing, dang I only got a video, I wanted to enjoy the moment, and I went on a picture booth with Ethan, and I think I had some nice fun, reminiscent of fall getaway which was like a month and a half ago, and it still feels so far away, but yeah I also had a decently good workout..But now I'm tired and gotta wake up early for visit day tomorrow, ciao..Also had a call for DM and stayed behind to talk with Caleb and Ethan

AND MY ARMS WERE AND ARE DEAD LOLL, I found that if I relax my shoulders, I can swing so much faster. Civil can play, meaning that we can get into the finals! I had my meeting with Dan, not really a meeting, just a catch up sesh with the reply stuff and RN I'm waiting on a response from Brenda. ..It seems like my parents also haven't actually started my F2 to F1 visa change of status thingy, and I have conflicting emotions, but it's not like I can change anything so whatever happens happens...Oh oh also I coded my new technical writing website, it's at ara-tech-writing@vercel.app or sth, also talked with Betty nyny and lama today which was nice

Dangit we gotta get stuff for art supplies. My unease about driving is slowly wearing off again,and I am pretty tired so off to bed for me

    Entry: Today was a pretty good day, I was going to say I suppose, but it really was a pretty good day, started off nice, had a nice breakfast, twas chill, then linear algebra, i was also able to get some good progress for the CAT I'll try to get it all done tomorrow morning, then send them an email later in the day, it's looking good tho!! ..Following that, I had my meeting with reply labs and I think it went great, except for my visa :D, 🎇🎇🎇 fun 🎇🎇🎇, I'm trying my best not to look into whether F2 visas can work at all, and I'm not going to over think it, and whatever happens happens, so Im just going to wait for her response, and if it's a go, thank God, if not, thank God as well? Rn im just focusing on may his will be done, and in this case, may his will be done. Once the process is finished for me, then I'm sure I'll still have that connection to pursue down the line, which will be great I hope...I'm still semi occupied about my driving test, not as much as yesterday and the day after the close call, RN I'm at the phase of, I'd really like to pass it, but there is definitely the fear of failure, and I don't want to fail, so when my brother is driving, I've been imagining what I would do in those scenarios, like driving in my head, and I think it does help me keep that practice, like visualization, and it is helping me boost my confidence bit by bit, which is nice...Then! For the fun part, I met with trayvin and he was in a call with Dr mina and she accused him of plagiarism and I was pretty worried but told him I'll talk to Dr mina so I sent her a message and she was like , okay cool I'm gonna give him a zero tho, but I pleaded with her enough for her to let him do a redo, and I walked through the presentation with him, hoping that he would then be able to go through the entire thing himself, but at this point now it is up to him, so we'll see 🥹, let's hope he doesn't disappoint!! I really hope he does well and can at least recover some points 🥹🥹. ..Then I went to Andy and led a mini session with Ben, then went to tdr cause I didn't have a ton of time and the food was so good ,these chips especially, but I had to leave which did stop me from over eating which was good, then went back to help explain stuff to trayvin and worked some more on the ld ibt. Thennnn  I went to workout, it was a good workout I suppose, then went to seed room and chilled for a bit, worked a bit on data mining with the duckateers, and now I'm here, so pretty good day all in all, also back to watching the chosen which, the show is still great

    Entry: Gotta do a better job of recording what's happening as they happen :(, today started off pretty chill, we changed the blinds and it makes everywhere look more airy, then ate a big breakfast, like 1k calories 0-o, 6 medium sized potatoes lol. ..Then we get to the driving part 🥹, idk if I put it here but I scheduled my driving test for 10am on Saturday, I hope the roads are freer then, they prolly will be, a man can hope, but I drove with my mum to everyday foods and I almost hit a car, I was merging into the turning lane but didn't signal OR check my mirrors, and a car was there and the person in the other car flipped me off :(, now I'm kinda curious, but dude it was such a surreal experience, thinking back on it, like, a different kind of experience in a different domain, a random person who I'll never cross paths with or meet again!! But whatever, yeah, things I have to work on, overturning, and under turning, I definitely have a fear of under turning, checking my mirrors, which I think I do better at when given enough time to react, but still it did decrease my confidence in driving a significant amount, which is a bummer, especially since I've got my test next week!!! The fear of failure is definitely there, which is a bunmmmer, but then again, this is another aspect of my life which I can't just write away or run away from, so "I'll" confront whatever comes my way. ..Speaking of confrontations, bad segue to a topic I didn't want to touch yet lol, but here it is, Andre and Ben have definitely been going through a rough patch, I can't say that I haven't though, I think the projects are bringing a significant amount of stress to both of them and burnout seems to be the prevailing theme. I won't say I'm burned out, but the weekend was much needed, but I'm trying to be objective and find myself semi agreeing with Andre and not with Ben, but idk if it's because I want an excuse to rebel? Especially since he's essentially taking the project manager role, and sometimes it bugs me, and he bugs me, and I don't want our relationship developing into the same kind as with my brother. ..Adeife just sent me a snap, I should connect with him too lol. But I had something else to say, yeah I definitely needed this weekend break, there are moments where I just don't feel like doing any work but I also sometimes feel that a low lying undertone of work will be best, like active recovery for my brain. ..I also have my interview with reply tomorrow! And I found out that my brother also has an interview with them, and it does not worry me as much as it would have in the past I believe, and I am praying that the interview goes well, maybe I should just think of it like a friendly chat, which it probably is, and I'm most likely getting really attached to reply and the work theyre doing lol. Idek what I'm saying anymore I'm really tired...I feel like there's something I'm forgetting to add, or say. Hmm..I don't feel like I've laid everything out. I gotta head to bed tho, oh now I remember, about my streak, I'm prolly not In the best head space? That sounds a tad bit extreme, but essentially I'm not doing well and apart from actually releasing, I'm just back to where I was before, with the essentially numb feeling that comes with it. Semi long entry already but it makes me wonder whether I am just spinning my wheels and if I just essentially already messed up my streak and should reevaluate why I'm doing it, which has me thinking a bit, but I really don't want to keep risking things, also I'm definitely spending too much time on reddit plus shadow fight, which kinda reminds me of my internship days loll ..Right now I have two pressing worries ..- messing up my interview with reply .- my driving skills and test..Which both may seem like big things now, but I'm sure in the future I'll look back at them and scoff, or laugh, or cry, or feel indifferent, whatever happens, next week will come around and go as quickly as this went around, as this entire year! Went around, so whatever happens happens, in headed to bed now, we can talk more mañana

    Entry: SO CLOSE to not resisting, like, literally there 🥹, unfortunately this might be a trend, today was a messy combo of emotions and I should've written during those points. Starting off with the coding club which was good, but I had my driving lesson from 1 to 3 so I had to hurry, I think I'm getting better :D, well, I am getting better, with more practice, and I scheduled my test for next week Saturday, also cause the deadline for my TIP hasn't reached yet..Deadline isn't the right word but whatevs. then tomorrow I'm driving my mum so we can get water, but I'm nervous about it! And whenever I think about it, I get worried cause I don't want her shouting instructions at me - putting this as directly as possible, but then I ground myself in the present and it's usually very effective. Even for good things, I can't remember what but I had to remember to ground myself in the present. ..But for the highlight of my day, Michael texted and we spent a while catching up, it was kinda nice, hes doing a class called geomatics, and we talked about the economy, professors, he's going to the same college with Ogo, which is cool, he was talking about some drama with a girl and friends, he gotta stop getting GFS 😭, but it was nice to catch up..oHHHH SNAP I CAN UPLOAD MORE THAN 3 PICTURES NOW, just found out by accident LOlll. ..I'm not gonna overuse it and just stick with 3, but it's still sweet...I've still been watching adventure time, some episodes are better than others, but it's still chill. But yeah this morning and even rn, I got so close to losing the 45 day streak, it kinda worries me that part of me know that I'm eventually gonna lose it ;-;, I can't give up tho, 45 days!

ACSO had a mini game night, like 5 people, twas just chill which was fine ..Bruh almost forgot to talk about visit day, my brother was on campus and it was kinda weird loll, I was helping out with the VR project, in preparation for next week, and I showed some people my Tic tac toe and maze project which was nice, I also saw Thomas I think from accelerate kids and Sandra, I think, from accelerate kids lol, she def forgot about me but remembered after a bit, we showed her the VR project. Also I showed project fit, the windows 10 clone, and the online Tamagotchi, which was sweet ..Seed also had it's food thingy and i.dkdn't bring any food so I didn't go, also my skin hurts, like the ribs when I twist and stuff, maybe I'm just so sore 🥹, today's workout wasn't that great. Then I ran with Andre which was chaos and my left leg toe felt like it was gonna cramp :*)..I turned in some work and did my assignment 5 tho, which was sweet, I can focus on the last course point and the ibt changes, flip I gotta respond to her email, imma do it tomorrow...Still watching adventure time and sometimes it's nice to just chill around with the characters.

Bit of lightning which is nice, my stomach hurts tho 🥹, maybe cause of tdr lunch, idk, to me it tasted amazing. ..I did a fair much amount of coding and my brain needs rest, reply labs got back go me about an interview! And I'm semi excited semi nervous semi worried 🥹, just gonna let God take the wheel and pray for the best, also same deal with my driving exam, I'm developing some more confidence in my ability to drive which I hope will help me...Also learned Ali has hepatitis A, or B, something from bad drinking water, which is a bummer ;(, I hope he gets better. I was pretty sore today tho, legs and a teensy bit of chest. Very non sequitur transition but I was able to help Trayvin get his code working, there's a chance that there are some bugs, but it should be alright. I'm super tired dang. We also had the federated learning meeting and it was super interesting. Friday is visit day, this week, yeesh..These journals have been shorter cause I usually end the day pretty tired, that should change by the time thanksgiving break rolls around

    Entry: Flipping self doubt is a bummmmm, driving went pretty well today, I've gotten much better at parking and turning, he let me do multiple turns on my own, but then i got home and I just feel myself doubting myself, as if I'd forget everything I just.learned, same with in parking, and it's annoying 🥹, and today was a baddddd day for resisting temptation, I still resisted, but the things I saw and read is very much no no. ..In happier news, I finished gen V and I really liked it, even though the end was kinda sus...We won the beat saber tournament!! It took like an hour lol, but it was fun..But yeah self doubt is getting to me a lot more than usual, idk if this will just be isolated to learning how to drive, cause I guess it's sth that is not accessible to me so I don't get a lot of positive reinforcement, but I have to say that it was nice to be able to turn on my own. I do have to continue learning to smoothly speed up at the start and relax when turning. I think my blue shoe works better for driving tho..That's all from me, I've been spending an unholy amount of time on reddit

    Entry: Just finished my driving lesson, and I also drove with my mum earlier today and practiced driving. Omg I just remembered a memory, a small cat came near me and it reminded me of temi and the cat She took in and fed, that memory was buried so deep dang,.or at least deep enough that it never crossed my mind...I was driving on the freeway and the sun looked so beautiful! The reflection of it on the floorit was chef's kiss. We practiced parking and I'm getting better, also turning, with my mum I did turns on my own and they went pretty well! I have 2 more practices left and I think I'll be knowledgeable enough God willing...My acceleration and breaking is smoother, and freeway driving is nicer. This session felt a lot faster, or at least a lot smoother, they lost my file xD. I'm getting slightly better at changing the steering wheel on turns but I'm getting better, he didn't shout at me today lol, just said easyyy, like, I should be limp, I still find it hard to relax but over time imma adjust. My brother went for the kapor thing in the building I did the robotics club in central and he brought back a veggie burrito, and it was delicioussss. I stored some of the data from the IBT but I felt pretty drained of energy so I didn't do a lot more than that, also had the coding club call, but I left early, and we worked with dockers, I think I'll practice tonight...Once I get home, maybe taking the donut, and working on mantas computle while watching adventure time..Oh I forgot, I also started gen V and it's a pretty good show

Okay resisting temptation is getting easier, which I'm happy about, sometimes I still feel the temptation feeling and it does feel kinda nice, but it's also bad, so Im still controlling It...I read more of the case for Christ, and got some good progress on CAT. Also finished adventure time season 1, and it took a while to get with the flow but I can see it's gem-ness..Ethan's also sick again 😭😭..Tomorrow WE DRIVE, wish me luck 🥹🥹🥹

Bourta start reading John and imma head to bed..Wait I didn't continue, then I worked on reimbursement project, then reimbursement proj go, then CAT, so today was a busy day

    Entry: It has been a while since I've had a truly stimulating mental conversation, wait I said that wrong lol, truly mentally stimulating conversation, it's cause Ethan and Noble were talking about Calvinism and I had a bit of FOMO, but less FO more IKIA - I know I am lol, I haven't practiced driving and it's kinda making me a bit scared, that I'll not necessarily forget, but the refinements I've been making will kinda dissipate, which is a bummer. I can try to see if I can drop my younger brother off lol ..But going back to mental conversations, none comes to mind, especially about religion, and the easiest reason for me is that I'm surrounded by mostly the same people so we know and understand each other's beliefs, maybe I have to start going out of my way to have conversations like that with other people, like kasheem! ..Hmm,I haven't been playing sky as much unfortunately, but I'm still keeping up with what's going on, I'm not pressured to buy cosmetics from this season so I can enjoy the game in my own time which is kinda nice...Also happy Halloween!! There were people trick or treating as we were coming home and it was pretty funny. I had a sick workout, my upper body was stiff but good stiff, it was nice..I also had a call, not with Tehani, but the other person and she answered my questions so I gotta continue the speed run!!

Today was semi slow, tomorrow is going to be a busy day, but hopefully good busy, hopping from class to class, gonna have a meeting with Tehani answering questions I have about the CAT updates, made some good changes and semi good.progress today.

But also that means that when I finally master, "master", turning, it'll be a lot sweeter! Like mastering accuracy, "mastering" accuracy, in beat saber

    Entry: Prolly a strange emotion to use today, today had a lot of milestones! Kinda two, maybe another of three, 30 day streak 🥹🥹🥹🥹. Okay so I'll start with my start of the day, pretty chill, read the bible, then Oriekaose called and woke my brother for the hackathon. We didn't win, and the others didn't win - from data mining class, and I was surprised that Oriekaose's team didn't win, but whatever, like I said Caleb was also there towards the end so kinda chatted with him, he's learning Hebrew. ..Then went back home, tried to get some more work on the CAT, then my brother drove me to the driving test place. And here is where the weird feeling kinda commences. Driving is another milestone, a pretty big milestone I think, even though so many people do it, so many , less intelligent , people do it. So it kinda worried me a bit 🥹, that I was already at my next milestone and the milestones will be getting more and more infrequent, like I know I will get used to the feeling of driving, even though it still feels so new to me, but it'll take practice just.like anything else. And even though driving for 2 straight hours felt boringgg, especially since there was no goal, I think it still gave me good practice. Parking is tough tho so we'll see, definitely need more practice there ..So that's why I put conflicted, cause plus another hand, Im kinda imagining myself as a parent and seeing my children slowly and slowly moving further, which, dang I'd be sad. But I'm not even a parent and heck I could die tomorrow..In other happier news tho, I reached a 30 day streak! And temptation was pretty high today compared to baseline, but I'm losing the appeal and I feel the myelin sheaths weakening..OH AMAZING NEWS, I found out tailwind preflight is what messed up all my css styling!! And disabling it fixed everything which was amazingggg

I'm in the fitness center rn still suppressing having to do the driving learning tomorrow, which I'm not super worried about, but I have the hackathon as well, and then have to go there, which is a hassle and a half, but we'll see. We'll see! 🥹. I still have my dad's work to help with and the CAT which idk how much of it I can work on tomorrow cause I also had to come on campus early 🥹..So I definitely need a good night sleep, tomorrow might seem like a day and a half but I only have 2 things to do, and I've had to do much worse! So everything will be fine, a nice lil wave of comfort washed over me lol, it's only two things and I believe I'll have enough time for other things..I also had a pretty good workout today

Something like that and it was really funny. My workout was also pretty great, and I tried to continue reminding myself not to sandbag it, idk why I keep using that work but it works xD. ..But then I went on a call with the duckateers and we went over the data mining assgn, okay after this I'm reading the Bible cause I kept forgetting to earlier today! And I'm not gonna make it skip my mind again, so yeah data mining assignment turned in, data mining class was, something. The tension was so thick cause a lot of people got bad grades 🥹 and I kept being the only one answering questions lol. It was pretty awkward, I wanna sleep early, I gotta go to campus early tomorrow for the symposium and my.brother is leaving by 11 ;-;,..Tomorrow is going to be a pretty busy day, but I am sure I've survived worse. First driving training Saturday, still ignoring the nervous feelings lol, it keeps me from doing anything out of my comfort zone..Side note: i made some decent progress on the CAT, and I added tailwind and it's so flipping nice omgggg

I didn't get any down time, and my legs and neck are sore, neck especially! I turned in ethics paper but did it wrong so I gotta re turn it in 😭😭, sent her an email and if she doesn't respond, I'll join her Friday class and go from there xD. ..I'm also withholding the nervous energy from my first driving test, and I think it is working pretty well :D. It also rained today, and I did cardio, and I worked on some annoying forms for the CAT. But tomorrow.im gonna start on the actual test, wish me luck, and then collecting the data

I think it's because the file system naming changed, and idk if I fixed it already or not, I'm waiting back on her email back, I should've done a development server 😭😭😭, ugh my neck is sore!! But essentially AAAAAH, ..Update, I found.tbe issue! It's in my .env files ahhhh..EDIT..CRISIS AVERTED, LIFES GOOD!! it was because I left out the .env time but it should be working now

Ofc j have progressed in some ways yadda yadda, but still :*)...Did some work on my dad's papers and bless the people that made chst gippity, I should be done with it relatively quickly, decided the best way to stop worrying about it was to get it done. Did some more coding and kept thinking about the stuff I wanna learn, also almost got sucked into Pauline Christianity but I'm nipping it in the bud before it starts to make me question and doubt myself and my faith. Played some sky, got back some assignments and comp sec midterm. We got extra credit which was super nice.

    Entry: Semi bummy day with very much bummy moments scattered. Went for visit day and thought I was going to get kidnapped 😭😭, there were two people in the car, the dude was smoking and looked creepy, he took another direction and stopped for this random woman. I thought he was just looking for people that looked like they were looking for sth, pick them up and that's is, then I thought he was going on the freeway, wow so many things could've gone wrong today, thank God!!!!..Visit day was great tho, dr mina was there, the rotations were so fast, Logan, Al harith and Ricardo were there too, which was cool. Al harith is pretty jacked, I didn't know he worked out. But I was looking at my training past and now I feel like I'm sand bagging my training 🥹🥹, like my progress isn't linear of course, but it's still all over the place and I find myself not lifting as much as I did in the past months which is such a bummer. Like I did 245 for 12 in freaking may on squats and now I do what? 255 for 9 😭..I DID 255 FOR 9 IN JUNE WHAT THE HECK. I think my brain is holding my body back?? I don't even know 🥹, I freaking did 265 for 8!!! For 9 0-o, something is definitely.up with my training. AND IVE BEEN DOING 50LBS ON HYPEREXTENSIONS SINCE JUNE???? Same with 235 for 7?!! 145s on bent over row, 80s on barbell curl. ..I definitely.have to confront that I might be getting weaker. But I still get sore and stuff?? Like, what the heck have I been doing this entire semester. Maybe just one giant plateau. I don't even know, it usually doesn't even feel like I'm slacking when training, I go decently close to failure, almost to failure..Now just spent way too long scrolling on Reddit, I have been watching the chosen and it's pretty great. Didn't get much work done but got some coding in go done. Being faced with my lifting plights is kinda frustrating, and it leaves me wondering if I'll be able to continue progressing properly, which is semi scary, like I'm imagining myself trying to move the weights on Monday and not being able to do it. And then also Ive been restricting my eating cause I'm definitely getting chunky and chonky, especially in the face and I've been trying to hide from it. AAAAAHUUUGH, I know I've felt like this before. I still have time to get into the rhythm again

Right now I'm conflicted,  I don't like the idea of Ben getting more jacked than me, but then again my jacked-ness is not my identity, and it's.something that like, essentially I didn't use to pay so much attention to it, like I'm not the kind of person to pose in a mirror, way too shy for that, but it's also not the type of person that I am, even switching to hypertrophy training made me feel weird. ..So essentially I think it's a very similar discussion to the one I had earlier in the week, I don't want to be defined by my intelligence and then be looked down on for failure, so I choose to define what success is for myself, and now I don't want to be looked down for my physique or maintaining a mediocre physique, but then again, there have been multiple times where I truly want to step back from heavy lifting and focus on cardio, and I enjoy having a good body, it makes me feel confident and my workouts give me time to think, usually not as much thinking going on lately, but still, maybe I'll start working out in silence lol. ..I had Cru dinner with Titus, Sophia, Ethan and Noble and it was cool, and my chest is sore lo..Justto echo some thoughts in my head, i was never doing it for other people, just myself, like the days of being awkward about talking about the gym or fitness, and I have definitely evolved so much from since then, but I still feel awkward showing off my physique and I can't deny some part of me still believes that it's because I'm small, but an even bigger part of me had a goal and set out to achieve it but is afraid of pursuing other goals for the fear of other people, I should stop worrying about other people, or worrying in general, we just had a dang cru session talking about worrying. I could cut back my workout to 3 days and do full body, and get good cardio in, or even get cardio in in general, ugh I gotta think about this more

    Entry: 20 days baby!!! And I've been so busy that it hasn't been occupying my mind a ton. I started off today working on technical writing paper plus my dad's work, but today was a bundle of.laughs. skipping to the highlights, there was an issue with the computer security midterm, and we were all just hanging out in the chat, then also in the call with Ethan and ben and i was looking through my quora questions and like, wow 🤣🤣 some of them were truly hilarious 😭😭, what sound does knocking make 😭😭. No way I'm deleting my quora account, I did remove it from being indexed tho. ..Still it was fun, computer security midterm was horrible but we do with what we got. I'm not that worried. Had to rush today tho! But I got a decent workout in with noble, it didn't make my wrist terribly worse, but we'll see, vamos a ver. Dr Hill sent a message thanking me about the idraw thingy, and I gotta ask him about continuing working but lately I've been super busy, like, today in the morning I'd say I was relatively busy, not too busy tho, then once.i got on campus, statistics, then fitness center for stats hw, while watching some Simpsons analysis which was nice, then ethics, then workout, then semi meeting with Yvonne, side note, met this dude who runs the ai hackathon thingy, then midterm hackathon, then starrvinggg, also had some of Norman's churros and two Welsh gummies I snuck in from Cru lol...Then went home and nommed delish food while watching the Simpsons. Also now trying to convince jezelle to join the ethics bowl. For now, I'm going to snoooze

    Entry: Today was another day and a half, and I'm coming up on 20 days yo!! I don't wanna like think that I've beaten the habit, cause I can't imagine the dread I'd feel if I succumbed, but like, I'll just come out stronger and better than before. Wow today was truly a day lol. ..Started the day early and wrote more notes for data mining, thenn headed to campus, we had the midterm immediately, so I got working on that, and I leave the results to God 🥹...Moving on, technical writing was okay, I'm gonna do my paper on html, imma work on it tomorrow morning, then from technical writing, we got Cru and we got Erin, Aaron? To join us, he's married and has a daughter! He's done a lot and seems like someone I can learn a lot from. ..Then I realized I double booked myself, for the cru game night.plus the Dr Hill thing, which luckily Ricardo and Brandon were there, uhhhh i'm bummed that I haven't been able to work out in a while. Imma start again during ethics. I played some beat saber tonight just to keep my body moving. It's also delosd week but I don't wanna deload. ..Anyways tho, I need to lose weight, my headshots came in, and they weren't looking good, I don't even have a jawline :(, so yeah going on a cut, not a big one, but definitely watching what I eat..I say as Ive had 4 pizzas today. ..Also I set up everything again from scratch for the research with Dr Hill to get everything running for the profs and it worked! So happy, thank God!! I'm super tired rn so imma wrap up, then I headed to the movie night after the presentation, there were so many Spanish speakers there, then talked with Andy and Ethan for a while, went home and played some BS. Then graded the lab for today, it was nice, while watching Archer Tok...Goodnight tho, it's flipping late

    Entry: Rn I am pretty relaxed, like chill,I also feel like I got a good productive day today, and I have my driving test tomorrow, so may God be with me 🥹, I feel semi prepared, but also not, so we will see how it goes. Im not ultimately fully stressed, but I know I'll have to take my time, take things one step at a time, and I'll come back to you tomorrow with the results ..I was working on the poster for the Dr Hill research stuff and couldn't find my data and I semi feel like Dr Hill is angry ish with me, not really, more like disappointed, but I'm not losing sleep over it, it's like, eh, what's there is there, so I'm fine with that. ..Played some beat saber and my shoulders hurttttt, good hurt, and horizon worlds and met a fun server, then played this horror game, not very scary tbh. Got a good amount of work done, and even transferred my java projects over to GitHub!!..I had so many weird dreams last night, most of them were about coding, I think I wrote here about the one with the crashed plane! I had one in a toilet stall where I was tall enough to look over it, another one where I was driving a mario kart, Dreams are sick!..Also I was watching the Simpsons and I still love it 😭😭, the jokes, chefs kiss..I'm still going strong! It's getting easier to resist temptation, especially since now it's not usually there..Sickkkk I just turned this journal in and saw that I made it to 3 weeks!!!

    Entry: A man's plane crashes on the top of a tavern as I was outside and unfortunately be dies but I lost it online and it becomes a national phenomenon with like memes and stuff, then I make an online game that's like, a grid interface and you are trying to beat the CIA by trying to trick them that you're using ur credit card in a place when you're not and they can cl your bluff and you can get addons and then even the operators can win, it looked so fun
    
    Entry on 2023-10-14
    My mood Unsure
    
    Entry: I'm like tipping towards the scale of unaccomplished, because today I feel like I spent my time accomplishing essentially nothing, but that's not also why I'm unsure, I feel like I'm pushing some emotions down that I don't want to fully push down but acknowledging them would make them feel more real, but they are real so here we go ..First though, a quick rundown of my day, woke up at 9 30 ish! Latest I've woken up for as long as I can remember, did chores And got to working on the poster for research, I got to a decent spot and was able to understand a bit more about the research I was doing, which was good. ..Sent that to Dr Hill, I also especially spent the day watching Doom patrol, but continuing, then I played horizon worlds and played this game called citadel with some pretty fun mechanics and good visuals with this random kid, it was nice, I got tired towards the end and contemplated disappearing on the kid but decided not to. ..We finished the game and it was nice. After that, started setting up the environment for comp sec, which is where my feelings of unaccomplishment come in. I wasnt able to set it up but I did push past some errors so it wasn't all bad. ..Then I got on a call with Ben and he was talking about communication issues and stuff, and we talked for a long while, and then we just laid it all bare, I talked about feeling like the reimbursement project was being held over my head all this time, and he talked about calling me out when necessary, I told him when I felt attacked, the dudes freaking 4 years older than I am, which is not an important detail, but I put it down And im leaving it there, the conclusion was that communication is hard between teams And many things sent unsaid, I talked about feeling like I was being blamed for making the project a reality, and he saw my situation, and even though his suggestion was talking more, or communicating about going ahead, i felt like i made surs to keep them in the loop, but maybs they felt differently, ugh auto corrext is broken again..Then he was just talking about me making a good developer and it kinda annoys me to have the pressure on me, and I do tell myself that I'm the only one that determines whether I'm a success or not, and for the most part I believe it, and I think even my relationship with God is getting stronger to the point where I try to focus on that as a sense of being, but it is reminiscent of the case where people talk about the, not overachievers, but like the gifted feeling the pressure to not fail, or the imagination of how bad it would look to end up just as a mediocre adult, and part of me is scared, part of me couldn't care less, part of me feels like somsthing out of my control would screw me..Any of them could be right, and I could just as well die tonight, so the cynical or nihilist or maybe even realistic part of me is like, what's the point. I'm just saying this so I don't push these feelings down, I suppose my takeaway is that I'm not defining myself by my past, and others may tend to do that, but I choose how I react to situations in the now, musing over the past is unnecessary,..That's for the past, for the future, anything that happens happens, and it will not be influenced by others opinion of whether I'd be the next Elon musk or herb Powell. The person who is existing in this body is me ( future me please don't cringe, it's Rita's catchphrase and I kinda like it 😭😭 )

    Entry: Today was chill with a bit of overcast. Listened to Roy shakked in the cold with my hoodie, it felt reminiscent, there's still a point in my life that I cannot pinpoint!!!! Like some jesca hoop songs take me there, but like, I can't pin point it!!! It's annoying 🥹🥹🥹...Today was chill tho! We had the acso game night and it went well!! We had a good amount of people, like 8, which is good! Consistent. ..Also the beat saber tournament, I think during it, the secrets of accuracy got unlocked in my head and now in good scenarios I can hit 100s consistently, it's just about semi curving it, like a whipping motion, gets it moving faster and more in the center I think, anyways it was good, I got a really high accuracy score which made me happy, full combo. ..We had the seed painting thingy, which was fun, might be a shorter journal today, idk if I put this here already but I had a dream about being able to you know what, but stopping myself, and it did motivate me, and still does..Oh also Christian bought be dinner and we talked for a while, and played cards

    Entry: My mood has been relatively so stable, but I had an amazing moment, I realized I hadn't seen Christian in a long while, so I texted him and met up with him at the fitness center to play table tennis, I hadn't.played in a while and I destroyed him all 4 games, like, it felt like the ball went where I wanted it to go, I felt like the mc, or side mc from the tennis anime loll, I wanted to keep on playing cause it was fun jumping around! ..Flip, I  semi forgot, we've been flip flopping between doing the acso game night or not, so I'm just gonna do a mini one, Oriekaose is discouraged but I don't want the momentum to stop 😤😭, I've been editing the Titan fest videos and I like the result, still have a ways to go loll. ..Hmm what else, today was a chill day, omg nevermind by Roy shakked just started playing and I realized I hadn't heard his voice in what feels like so long, it felt so comforting. It's finally fully getting cold! Didn't wear a jacket today tho. Workout today was sick, another leg day, did chinups for 10 reps too, twas amazing, my neck is sore as heck lol. So are my legs 🥹, well just hamstrings, they're going to be so much sorer tomorrow. ..Lol I can't forget the feeling of tennis, we played spades after, and Christian can play euchre, which was nice to know, it felt like I had a lot more fine controls, and idk it kinda scares ish me, doing sth then stepping away then coming back to be good, ish at least, at it, it also happened in bowling ..Just realized my jaws have been popping more than normal, gotta not push it so I don't get tmj again. I also had really bad stomach pains!! But they got better thank God, I also started sitting in the front just go absorb road going abouts. ..I'm glad we don't have to go on campus early tomorrow, got meetings with dr Hill, dr bani Taan too, I'm just craving plantains for good reason. It's decently late, I'll read the bible and clock out, speaking of which,..Also I had a dream with the duckateers where we visited Ethan in the past and almost broke the space time barrier loll

    Entry: Back to school 😭😭😭, 2 weeks, I've gone 2 weeks, which feels like a dang long time, I worked on a teensy bit of code, mostly fixing a bug with hound cause I'll be presenting it to the students, good thing no Dr mina quiz tomorrow, ..I took another Myers Briggs test and got INTJ again! I did tailor my answers to lead to it kinda, but still xD...Mistakenly closed out but bless daylio developers, ethics.class was pretty interesting, I tuned out of comp sec class completely, took off headphones for quiet time and a case for faith and started taking notes, then I got superrr hungry cause the only thing I had in the morning was hot cocoa and like 7 cracker pieces lol, and cheese, slices of cheese!..Also I know I smelled really bad today 😭😭, sweated a lot during my workout and, it wasn't pretty, I cooped myself up in the library away from others 🤣, but my outfit was one of my fav combinations! The tucked in athletic t-shirt and sweatpants and the jacket, made me feel cool but also stupid when working around other people lol..I'll see if I can try sth else new tomorrow

    Entry: Today was a cesspit of interesting emotions, most common one was horniness lol, I've used that word more over the last 2 or 3 days than in like, months of years here lol, I'm definitely feeling the effects, but then I remember that I'm about 2 weeks in now and the pain that it'd cost me to try to get back to this point isn't going to be worth it, so I'm still sticking with this, for the long run, gonna try not to make it a daily thing to mention, but I'll be busier over the next few weeks which is a good ish thing...Second emotion was fear! Like, not overwhelming fear, but pretty dang close, I went with my dad to get the letter of ineligibility to prep for my driving test, and the dude saw that my visa was expired, and was asking the other person questions, and there were security people in the place and stuff, and I got truly frightened - also side note, was reading about whistleblowing in ethics class and someone's phone being tapped for years, if y'all are stalking my phone, welcome? 😭😭, there's your warm greeting from me, anyways, part of me was like whelp, this is finally it, boutta be whisked back to Nigeria, then I calmed down, and just tried to center on God being with me, lately I feel like I haven't reached a "suffering" point that like draws me closer to God or something, and I keep feeling like it's overdue, so I was like whatever happens, God will be there to protect me, which did bring me a lot of peace, not total peace, but a lot of peace. ..As I'm still here, everything worked out fine, got my letter :D, we waited a while in the place, it's weird being around different faces, even udm tends to feel familiar, soooo, booked written driven test for next week Monday! I'm yet to fail one online but I don't want to be too overconfident, people say it's easy, but I don't want to be the overconfident type and then face the consequences, so I'm still doing practice questions, and I think I'm getting better ..Wrists still hurts, I've been putting a good amount of bad.pressure on it 😭😭. So yeah, horny,fear, some happiness tho, I tried making stuffed peppers and it was horrible, so that wasn't happiness lol, ice cream and being able to enjoy it was happiness, I should do that 1000 things I'm grateful for, one night I'll start with a hundred. For now tho, also played some VR, there was a new first experience game for hand tracking or sth like that, it was interesting but automotion was kinda annoying ..On to season 2 of doom patrol, Jordan yono is still texting back lol

    Entry: I've used the good emotion for the entire of last week, let's try sth new.lol. I do feel nostalgic tho, i rewatched the last 2 episodes of sonny boy, the weather is getting colder, also followed dad to social security office but it was closed cause columbus day 0-o, so we are going again tomorrow, right now listening to over the garden wall soundtrack. I've been feeling really tempted, and semi tempting myself, but then I think of how long my streak is and the pain it'll give me.to lose it, so nope, the stream continues ..Semi told my mum about action group, ALSO SKY PC, AND IT LOOKS GOOD!!!&nbsp; I gotta see if I can run it on Linux. Worked a lil bit on testing the new reimbursement site registration flow, I think I'm finally done with it :D, after a bit of bumming around, watching Doom patrol, got on a call with Ben and Ethan for the comp sec paper, we got some good work done, which was great, had a moderate amount of fun, but I randomly decided to text Jordan yono, he's a gopher that attended udm, and he responded! Which was sweet. Let's see how this blooms..Also I might be.going through another fashion phase, don't think it'll last long, but I'm realizing how bad fitting some of my clothes are..Also emailed Dr hill.about the abstract . Wrist still hurts, it feels like the pain moves around..Side post entry note, at night it was so quiet, like, pitch quiet, in the dark and the cold, I love winter/the cold or fall so much&nbsp;

Hmm, yeah the arcade was fun, not as fun as last time, but the go karts were really fun! Now that I'm not scared of hitting something or flipping over, I got to enjoy the speed lol...Tomorrow we go to secretary of state place to get letter of ineligibility for my written driving test, hopefully it doesn't take long :*), fall break woo! Oh also younger brother won a burger toy that I'm naming Penelope loll, got home and bummed out for a while, then did some coding, got login and registering functionality all functioning, started doom patrol which is getting pretty good,was tempted to stop watching. ..Uhh that's about it for today, transition lenses are sick. I'm still very much feeling a low lying lurking temptation, the feeling, but yeah 11 days in boys, make it 14 and we will be 2 weeks in yeah!!

    Entry: I think I'm on my.longest streak yet, which Is amazinggg, tomorrow we bowl!! I finished love death and robots, such, a, masterpiece of masterpieces!!! ..I did so much flipping coding today!!! Like, first decided that I wanted to do some python, test out that sleep dataset and do some classification, but it turned out to be absolutely boringgg, so I was like, haha no, hence, I did create a tree but didn't test it, jumped back into golang and worked on the login feature, bruh I think I did more than that today 😭😭, I set up some stuff for forgot password, and yeah, it was a semi lazy coding.day..Placed rumble on horizon worlds and it was fun! I'm enjoying the power ups a lot..The weather is also getting colder, and I got android 14! So new phone redesign, it looks sleek. Melancolia by caravan Palace is stuck in my head!! Oh also, did ethics paper 1, well, did more of it, that was my class productive moment today, but most.of the day was me trying to figure out stuff to do. We going to arcade and hibachi tomorrow!! Boutta eat, hmm I want more of the crab Rangoon, the chicken tho, might have to skimp on that 😭, then to the fun place for some.bowling perhaps, and more mini golf, I should.head to bed, my nose is stuffed tho, also today is Alegs birthday!! He's 17 now. Now that I've finished love death robots, I gotta look for another masterpiece..This entry is so disorganized 😭, but that's my brain rn, also My wrist still hurts and I'm trying not to think about it cause.it is kinda frustrating me, but whateverrrrr 😭😭..It just needs time, and I'm giving it 4 days, then I'm either back crushing the gym, or just leg day 🥹🥹. Okay that's all for tonight, hasta mañana chico..Oh I also had some interesting dreams, can't remember all of them but there was a tournament and Ethan and Abbie were there

    Entry: Another run of the mill day but still going strong! I'm beginning to recognize more how exposing myself to, reactionary, media, to put it nicely lol, essentially things that get me horny, aren't good for keeping myself together, and I was watching love death robots, an entire season and half of season 2 today, and it has a lot, a LOT of no no stuff, so I'm like, yeah, I did push through it to enjoy the absolutely stunning visuals, also finished star wars the phantom menace today I believe, it was good,..But yeah today was kinda vanilla, speaking of whicb I ate some ice cream, and didn't really enjoy it 😭😭, I'm getting old I know, the curse of abundance and hedonic adaption! I didn't attend the seed gardening thingy cause we left school super early, so I had a bunchhh of free time! So I did some coding, finally almost finishing the registering functionality, and soon on to the login, which I've already done setup for, my plan rn is to finish, and test all the commands and flow, make sure everything looks good, then start working on actual reimbursement stuff ..Dan helped me apply for the internship, which I don't want to get excited for, I do really want to get excited for it lol, but I'm like, temper your expectations, so I did, and now I'm more indifferent, at least that's how I'd like to feel, but I don't want to set myself up for disappointment, And it seems like there'll be interviews lol, it'll be good experience at least, even if I don't get in :*(, wow just zoned out to have an entire interview scenario in my head lol, but currently not making any promises to myself, gotta keep myself, :sparkles: stoic...Speaking of stoic, I got a 10 on Dr minas quiz!!! Which was surprising cause I thought I bombed it, Ethan was prolly more, we'll definitely more bummed about his score, oh allso earlier today we had a meeting about the ai project and ben the tyrant, that's what I'm calling him now loll, plus Omaran weren't actually the best combo 😭, they have very similar personality traits and i feel like it would bite us, somewhere at least. To give my legs a chance to grow more and my wrists a chance to heal, I think I should focus more on legs, and by focus more, I mean legs everyday 🥹🥹, that doesn't sound like a bad idea does it? Loll,..Wow it got late fast, gonna play sky then hit the hay, tomorrow, we bowl!!

    Entry: Ugh Ben's frustrating me with a pointless argument, my wrist was hurting more from chest on Mondays, so I'm deciding to take a break off till fall break till everything heals properly, and he's just trying to force an answer which annoys me, a lot, so I'm just.stepping out of the conversation..In more sane news, career fair was today, stopped by a few orgs, and the food was so good!! The meatballs and chicken were superb, then Dr minas class, I bombed the quiz, probably, we'll see ;-;, well not bombed bombed, but lowest grade so far definitely. Yeah as mentioned before, taking a break from my wrist to heal, I think it shouldn't take a long time, as long as I don't over stress it, so no beat saber either 😭😭, I am curious as to what's causing the pain tho, might look it more up..Okay so it's probably wrist tendonitis, which should heal, prolly like the TMJ healed too, etc etc, I have calmed down a bit, uhh, I feel like I'm missing sth from today, learned more.about bson and how it's used in mongo, and go, worked a bit on register, it's taking so flipping long!!!! I think I've been 2 weeks on it now 🥹🥹, this is going to be a longggg rewrite lol. ..Hmm, what else, no quiet time :(, but I am still reading the Bible in the morning, going to continue witht he Romans I didn't finish now..It gets pretty.late fast, see ya..also I wore the turtle neck! It was very itchy

    Entry: Pretty good day! Didn't have a big breakfast, an oily breakfast.perhaps, that was prolly a good amount of calories.looking back lol, but I made sweet.potato.fries and they were decent, I don't even remember what I was working on as I was doing that, but headed to school, did school stuff, went.to tdr and ate a bunch, was super.full, also today's my younger brothers birthday, all the time seems to be passing by quickly!! ..But apart from that, I shall continue, then did ethics, worked on stats test, woah I can't remember much from today lol, I can't even tell whether I was productive or not, but the quality of my day shouldn't be determined by how productive I was, gotta get rid of that old habit. We do what we can every day of the week. ..Side note, Ethan started working out and I'm super happy for him..So moving on, oh today I didn't have quiet time ;(, I had the opportunity to but didn't recognize me, Ethan was trying to get all his followers from Instagram and I wanted to do the same thing but it took me much longer than I expected, so I didn't work a lot on golang. All in all today was pretty blurry, nothing stood out, but that good!! I did watch a bunch a Simpsons episodes today

    Entry: I enjoyed cru today! Staying out of incriminating visuals is making you know what easier. Read more Romans in the morning and I did incorporate some quiet time today!! Even though it wasn't a ton, I read in the library. I'm finding it a bit harder to keep focus on what I'm reading, scriptures etc, just because of work on my mind or things I have to do, it's causing a general fogginess, cause I was surrounded by a lotta Christians at fall getaway, it was easier for the things I was learning or going through to stay on my mind ..Dang I gotta ask my mum, a) what visa I'm on, b) that I'm ready to take the written driving test aaaa. I haven't failed one and it'll probably be easy from what.most people are saying. ..Graded for TA today too, worked on golang registration, sometimes I get.overwhelmed by the handler interface and how chi connects with it but it's pretty easy..Edit ..Also Ethan's planning his workout routine!! We boutta him lifting boysss

    Entry: I am wholeheartedly missing fall getaway:*), the commercial hustle and bustle, and even using a car just felt so, tedious to me, of course I'll get back into the swing of things and partly forget what once was, I feel like the poetry reading made me more poetic lol, apart from that tho, I was semi productive today, didn't work on anything that big, don't think I worked on udm go, Dan asked for our resumes to try applying to an internship he found, ..I had a weird gym interaction! Three Chinese students were lifting next to me, I was doing incline bench press, and one went over and checked how much I was lifting, then I started lifting and could see him watching me, and when I was done he started clapping, like good job, his friends were lifting but now with full range of motion, which I wanted to help them fix, but the language barrier would probably definitely have been a lot, so idk :*)..Chess tournament started I guess, I won 3 games against Caleb, they were fun games tho, trying out new things,.finished world trigger today or yesterday and that anime was great!! Started shimineta but wouldn't finish it, it'll definitely make me more likely to sin, I'm distancing myself from things that'd cause me to. I know the things I look at that give me the desire to you know what, so I'm hoping to stay away from them. ..Also trying to keep up with the habit of reading my Bible in the morning, and I didn't remember implementing quiet time to read, so hoping to see how I'd fit it in to my schedule tomorrow..Also noble was there as I was lifting, just a side thing to mention

    My mood Nostalgic
    
    Entry: Already nostalgic loll, but the issue with experiencing something great tis that the baseline now seems less, good, I'm missing the freedom of being able to walk to Chamberlain, or meet random people or play euchre or go on a swing or take a random snack or cookie or sparkling water from the kitchen or watch the moon with stars or the sunrise with the bible or shower knowing that there are complete strangers near you and the warmth of the early sun on my skin is a feeling often taken very much for granted. Now I'm home, and will move back into a routine and would probably forget the sensations, and only remember the memory, maybe not even very well, but it'll be there..But now I'm back home, and I suppose I have the freedom of college! Going back and forth from the library to class to any other building I want, eating the delicious tdr food, this will definitely be a memory I'll miss, maybe next year! Even if I have to go alone..In the afternoon tho, I got hit with such a wave of tiredness, I ate and it's gone now, but I was on the verge of sleeping. In the spirit of writing things down and reflecting, here's what Iearned. First I should recap the day, I woke up, thank God, first to pee, then it was sunrise ish, I woke up at like 7 40 or 50 something, stayed in bed for a few and went down, then decided it would.be a good idea to shower first, so I did that, and brushed my teeth, Ethan and Titus were still asleep, so I grabbed my Bible, went to my bench and watched the sunrise till I felt the sun, then I went to wake up Ethan and Titus, so from there we headed to breakfast, then to campus times. ..Reflection 1 of the day, jealousy, especially envy, is a very much annoying presence still, Ethan was leading campus groups and the first and second time I felt the jealousy creeping up my face!!! I calmed down, but it's still there and is something I gotta talk to Andy and God about ..Then went to the session and it was all worship/praying, that went well, and I realized that I don't dislike worship as much, some of the songs were even getting stuck in my head, now just aurora is stuck in my head lol. Oh! After breakfast we had quiet time, I read a part of the case for faith on these skinny benches looking to the sky, then I went to Chamberlain, already forgetting the name :*), and Titus was in the room, so I went to the basement and found an empty room, so I just stayed there and read a bit more.in nice silence, continuing the recount tho! Then helped pack things up, Ethan lost his pocket knife which was a bummer :(, madi did a lot to try to help him find it. ..Then headed home with Andy and Madi, and the trip was cool, we talked about abortion and their stance, and planning merch, then I got home and played some beat saber but got annoyed when it was crashing so played horizon worlds and that was fun. ..Now I'm on the terlet, after doing a lil coding and a lil Simpsons watching 👁️👄👁️, reminiscing what was, and I am very very much glad that I went

    Entry: Today was truly great, had fun playing euchre with Ethan and Co, showered for the first time in a foreign place, did a just dance thingy and thought being able to dance like that would be so fun, I woke up and Ethan went to read the bible so I joined him but did it as the sun was rising outside and the warmth of the sun was so nice, I played volleyball and it was super fun, but I would've liked to kayak, can't swim yet, I'm on a swing in the middle of the night,.it's not very quiet but it's so nice. I also feel close to God, which is always a plus ..Terrible picture btw, I got to enjoy quiet time, got a book called the case for faith and was reading it on the grass and it was pretty quiet overlooking the lake. .I got to see the stars! Which I haven't seen since God knows how long,.just a nice rad day in general..Aw someone joined me

He looks freaking 20,..Also had to wake my brother up at like 9 30 today and class was in 9 50, also  rained for the entire day, which was perfect ..I compared a picture of Ben's brother to vector from despicable me and couldn't stop laughing lol

    Entry: Just got out of the poetry reading from Prof pickell and I'm very much unsure how to feel! Part of me feels very melancholic, that's a good word, another Prof, Molly Barlow, so made me feel very sad, and the first woman made a lot of eye contact with me and for some reason I wanted to cry. .It was definitely an interesting experience to say the least, and fall getaway starts tomorrow! And I've been getting on terms. With the apprehensive feeling, but like random feelings of excitedness? It's one of the bigger experiences that I'll have all year, because I'll be spending my first night away from home, only other thing that comes to mind was going to vicsums hostel because of the terrible traffic, and this is a lot bigger than that, I guess it's a step to commemorate turning 18! ..An entire day away from home, plus some...Today has definitely.been an, interesting day, very much interesting day

Gonna try to set up more acso stuff mañana, rn im pretty tired, it's raining so gonna head to bed, today was Mohammeds birthday too

    Entry: Ok this is something random I just.picked up from a school of life video, but I think it's something I did periodically, just in moments of "crisis tho", it entails thinking back about all the times I was deeply worrying or stressed about something, and compare it to the reality of what happened , I think something similar is going to happen for fall getaway, but worried or stressed isn't the right word I would use&nbsp;..Okay so, starting with my least favorite memory..- the SAT retake, because I didn't want to speak up, I had Richard pay, a lot of money, a lott of money, to hire, I don't even remember her name, to tutor me for the SATs, and I had to sit through it, and didn't tell my parents about my plans to take the SAT, and I had to do it in another school, with no transportation settled on or means of communication&nbsp;..Reality - it all worked itself out, I didn't have to take the SATs, Meisha? I think that's her name lol, got her money, and we didn't go further in the tutoring, Richard was understanding and I still have a working relationship with him, and now it is all in hindsight&nbsp;..Next worry - tying in with the sat, going to college, or a community college specifically, the worry was that my situation would make it super difficult to sort out, And I would end up having to go to WCCCD,&nbsp;..- That did not happen, and by God's grace I got a sweet scholarship, and I'm now a junior at Udm&nbsp;..Then we have me not going into ecology, and I found out that I do enjoy computer science a lot,..Telling my parents about fall getaway wasn't a disaster,..I'm hoping learning to drive.will be smooth enough, yeah, a lotta stuff I've worried about haven't been disasters or blown up in my face!

    Entry: Woweeee I'm tired today, but I am tempted to put great, Im still really enjoying golang, it fills me with happiness lol, tomorrow I'm gonna dip my hands in redis to cache the users user id, and we will see how it goes, cause jwts in urls is a bad practice. ..Then classes went okay, data mining was chill, technical writing was a work day and he said my work was great, didn't even need to call me up, then cru was also great, just prepped a bunch a stuff I'll need for fall getaway!! ..Chilled after Cru in the seed room, then went to ta, worked out, which I wasn't looking forward to, but was generally okay, the lower back pain messes my flow and my moving into other exercises, it's gone in squats tho, which makes me happy, or at least now it's sth that rarely limits my squats. ..I didn't go as heavy tho, what's dones done, gotta look Forward to tomorrow's workout, then Cru game night, help Andre set up beat saber, played euchre, had a good time, ate a lotta cookies, then went home, played Beat saber and turned in my scores, score saber is pretty cool, graded the work, and that's about it, tomorrow I'll do ethics quiz and start on Dr bani Taans assgn, rn I'm exhausted

    Entry: Today in general was a pretty good day, not ultra productive but what r u gonna do, started the day off coding, doing a lil bit of go, it was nice, go the jwts working and styling emails, twas nice, random note, I was thinking about my future and thought it'd be cool to be a really good freelancer and do work for big companies and work on stuff that a ton of people will use, freelancing is my current.goal but that could defffinitely change ..Anyways back to my day, did stats, then anime club, watched an anime called cencoroll which I am planning on rewatching because it's pretty good!! Then chess club, then had a nice.workout, throat has been feeling a lot better, then went for cyber security meeting, a few people I knew were there, no one came for recitation :(, anyways tho, them had some time to do stats hw before 8 30 when came.home, also joined up beat saber team, and set up score saber, gonna help Andre set everything up on his computer and quest tomorrow. ..Uhhh,cru game night tomorrow which I'm pretty looking forward to. Did some set up stuff for acso, did stats homework, tomorrow gonna do data mining assignment, Also ethics quiz ugh, still feeling a bit.pensivd for fall getaway, but it's not as intense as other pensive feelings.like before doing the first journi yte, I think it just comes with the territory of doing something new, gotta accept the territory,..Also had a reunioncito con Andy, gonna read a lil of the Bible now and head to dormir..Also love the song sixth sense

    Entry: Roy shakked just has a way with music, I just listened to the caught on fire instrumental and it got me to "vibrate", lol only I will prolly understand the sensation, but it's sth I haven't experienced in a while since not doing yoga anymore, idk if a caused b tho. ..Anyways, I've been a bit pensive about fall getaway, it's in 5 days, just got to not overthink it, in feeling a lot better, minor throat clears here and there, but all around feeling much better...Yoo his music is like, a time capsule, it just took me to a sensation of, I don't even remember the time period, felt like early COVID, dang it I can't pinpoint the time period of the feeling, but it's there! ..Played and thoroughly enjoyed beat saber today, then meta quests highschool something, some ghost game, which was fun, then the rumble which was also fun. ..Tried to do some coding in GEE and did some stuff but for the most part it was confusing and I didn't enjoy it as I thought I would, felt like I was just going in blind. Watched more family guy, which wasn't that bad, some parts are just bad, but I'm learning to get over them, now laying in bed listening to Roy shakked

    Entry: Chill, ish, day, didn't resist temptation twice ;-;, might as well just start calling it as it is, but I tried to make banana bread and put, an insane quantity of salt.i.gues, and threw it away, we win some we lose some. I got so annoyed and ticked off when my mum showed up and took over, then after i tried calming myself down, not letting the feelings weigh me down, and showed her how my glasses worked in the sun just to rbreak the ice. ..I watched a fair amount of family guy, and I liked the eps I watched, I watched two like 40 minute ones and those were good! Well, they were entertaining, I liked the clues one, worked on, and I think finished a mini tama, didn't want to at first, but took a go at it and got to all I wanted to do for now, im leaving it as it is, but I'll be reworking it in the future. ..Still got a cough but everything else is fine, worked with Ben on the software engineering poster and abstract. Got a 100 on technical writing paper, Woop woop...Idk if I can say this was the highlight of my day cause the headset was quite weighty on my head and took away the immersion, but I got to see what sky would look like in VR and it was sweet! There were a ton of other games too and I just spent the time exploring. ..I might refund journey, the game looks like it's gonna be amazing, but, idk, my laptop gets hot and I have to be on windows and I don't wanna spoil the battery more etc etc, I'll think more about it. ..I'm much more comfortable buying VR games lol. Hmm, since I'm done with Tama, I'm gonna focus on Google earth engine, I have a few projects I'm looking to do with it, data mining too for starters, so I wanna start using it, get comfortable with it, etc etc, I also wanna get more comfy with blender but having to go on windows blech, Im definitely 100 percent overlooking the amazing ness of my laptop, it does a lotta great stuff well, but I might have to start looking into getting a new one :*), not like, now, but in the future future, if the battery goes to the crappa. ..That's all for me tho, tomorrow, I'll work more on GEE, I really still wanna work with go tho, so imma do some go stuff, well I might do some go stuff, but ik I'll get carried away, so gee it is 🥹, there aren't a lotta tutorials but I'll make due ..Also I had like three dreams! One where I kept seeing rare animals outside the living room window and was taking pics of them, then they started acting weird and some Mario characters showed up, also there was a lotta those bouncy things I squeeze, it turned out that the neighbors something was going to our side and he wanted to take it back and I was trying to stop him..In another dream, I was trying to trick or mislead this person, for a good cause lol, but I can't remember fully :(,

    My mood Unsure
    
    Entry: Unsure again lol, I guess I'll start with my day, woke up with a sore throat but thank God it went away pretty quickly, I just chilled tbh, didn't do much of any type of work before class, just absolutely bummed out essentially. Then went to campus and had class, which was pretty chill, actually I had a fair amount of fun today, mightvs been great depending on if I had written this earlier ..So continuing on, went to workout after and Romanian deadlifts were great, lower back was happy, I have been doing a very minor movement, an anterior pelvic tilt, then I pushed my butt back,.which my spine didn't like, but when I just started holding the weight , no tilt, and.just push my butt back, then I got some good good weights! Just looked up strength standards, but disregarding those, I'm really happy with how it went. ..Also Brandon from technical writing was there, the dude is strong! Repping 90s on dumbbell bench press, I wonder if I could do that xD, prolly 😤😤...He gave me tips on the Romanian deadlift to take off my shoes, hhonestly I don't know what his deal is, not in a bad way lol, just in a I don't know what his deal is way. Then from there I think I just hung out, then went to seed which was fun! Played Egyptian ratscrew and had a buncha fun xD, won twice loll, then went to try setting up acso stuff and it was pretty easy, went back to fit cent and then worked on stats with Ben in the student union, wow 8000 steps today, just checked. Mark Formosa was there and Ben was chatting with him, side note I bought a peach smoothie and jezelle bought one as well cause it looked good loll, but I got jealous of Ben's ability, well, envious is the better term, of Ben's ability to talk and connect with other people, then I was thinking it over with myself and decided that it wasn't me and I usually couldn't care less about the other person :*), it wasn't a very long conversation with myself lol, bruh my mum is sniffling, I hope I didn't get everyone sick but I probably did 😭😭, I've been trying to put it off my mind, but it is a possibility, its prolly gonna gonna get off my mind, but yeah, i was enviohs of Ben's ability to be curious about other people...But something else changed my outlook on it, so continuing on, we finished the stats homework, thank God it wasnt long or especially "challenging", then I started to set up the place for acso and kammie was there, she was listening to a podcast on her.phone and I had marquees brownlees voice, then I asked if she was listening to Dr Mike and she was! Then I got the marquees part right too! Then she wastalking about people falling for bad stuff and.how he doesnt like it, and I was like Gwyneth Paltrow and I'm glad she recognized what I was talking about, took a big stab! But yeah we talked about that and I had fun, then we had to wait to gwt the food for like 20 mins 😭, then following that, we were planning on moving upstairs but stayed downstairs, which honestly was a good decision ..Some dudes were.playing cards, and the red head girl from bio lab called masa. So we set everything up, I think we had a good turnout, played the kahoot and people had fun I believe! Now I'm home and tired ish lol, but I also talked more with kammie about where she was from, and she was asking me questions and talked about how big grocery stores were loll, she also asked if I had a girlfriend, idk why, just putting that here 😭, ..But I'm glad everything went smoothly, for the most part, apart from the food and stuff, Christian was there too, and there is a thought that crossed my mind that I'm not gonna put here, I can't start distancing myself from him, I'm not, just, we are moving apart. ..Also gonna keep not worrying about fall getaway, it'll be here in no time and one year in the future me will be looking back like - first, heeeyyyyy ( in Alie wards voice for some reason ), I wonder what'll happen with this journal, do I just print everything out into one big book! That'd be amazing, but yeah, I really enjoyed talking to kammie and I think it brought back a conversation style that I haven't had in a long while, like just everything focused on that.person, getting to know each other, there was also a new student named Leah.

    Entry: I feel like I'm forgetting something 😭, well not really anymore, but before. Still feel sick, prolly COVID, trying not to delude myself, technical writing class was fun, ..Chilled out in sky, dang it I'm still thinking about fall getaway and now I'm like ehhh, but I should be like eee, you know what, it's prolly gonna be like eeee, I think I'll have fun, just gotta get out of my head about worshiping and stuff like that, this isn't a conversation I've had here before, but I'm still not a fan of standing and just clapping my hands, idk if it's because I've usually just done it lifelessly and felt like it was a chore, even though I know worship is great and all, maybe I just haven't experienced real worship? ..We will see when we get there, gotta drop my expectations at the table. Did pretty good on dr mina quiz, which was muy surprising,..I should be feeling about normal any day now, definitely before fall getaway, which is sth I'm kinda worried about, I've just been trying tk put away the idea that it is almost certainly COVID away from my mind and rationalize it, but it might just be hurting me...Tomorrow is acso game night, we'll see how things go! Favour is gonna Uber eats, I've set up the kahoots,

Hmm, then following that, listened to some Spanish songs while sweeping too, my face feels heavy, I get random momengs of looking forward to fall getaway, then not, back and forth 😭, okay just looked up the place and it seems sickkkk, now I'm excited to do it 😂, if it turns out great, maybe I'll go again next year. Lol I got really excited, well, I got excited, these days it's hard to find stuff to look forward to, rn jts this and winter, especially winter break, maybe Ive not been having as much fun as I thought, or memories just make things seem better than they really are :*)

    Entry: So my parents, specifically my mum, might be flaking out on me going to fall getaway cause of transportation, which I'd be very miffed about, she said I should ask about transportation, worst case scenario, I use Uber. Best case scenario, I just go with Andy and Maddie, mid case scenario, I go with someone else from Udm going with other people. If they say I definitely can't go, I'd be pretty miffed! I keep using the word miffed lol, but I'd be angry, I was holding my tongue and she was talking about safety and junk, and I get that, for now nothing I try to think up in my head will change the situation, so deep breaths, thank God my breathing isnt congested. ..I am coughing tho, so, corona? Bluch. Okay in the spirit of not worrying about what I can't change, I'm not gonna worry about that, my glasses come tomorrow! And my worrying about their PD has diminished. Uhh, watched some Futurama and worked on tama for a while, gotta find a mask cause I be coughing. ..I forgot how well animated Castlevania was. Oh also worked with Ben on data mining and comp sec stuff, today was a generally lazy day, future me, hi, I'm laying in bed about to fall asleep, and you prolly are too lol.

And I'll be back here like 'i survived as usual' lol, I asked my mum about fall getaway and she hasn't said anything, which I'm taking as probably a no, and she's ruminating over it, but I'm not that stressed, compared to before, about the JOURNi thing, I'll be chill, I'll be good 🥹. I'm also trying not to overwork myself about the glasses PD thing, vamos a ver, y vamos a sobrevivir. ..The seed dinner was cool, I am exhausted like forecasted, but the walk was nice, my pants were bunching up tho and it was awkward xD. Hello world by Louis zong is stuck in my head!! I think I ended today productively tho, watched like 2 episodes of the Simpsons, new season coming out soon! Not soon enough tho , didn't do much blender-ing today, mostly fixing up tama, and it's all fixed up now, gonna add the memory and health bar stuff feature soon enough, also side note, but Dr mina said she saw my website and really liked it loll,..I'm hoping to be productive over the weekend, gonna be going in swinging, I don't wanna live in the past and stuff, but it's getting hard to get excited about stuff, like the same feeling that I got from season of abyss or little prince, not just in sky, just in general, or about Christmas, okay I'm actually pretty thrilled about Christmas and winter, and the dark! ..We'll take things once at a time

    Entry: Didn't resist temptation, so not a very good start to a pretty seemingly draining day, yesterday I was really drained, and Ethan is goin to fall getaway and I want to ask my parents about fall getaway but just the tension and what ifs keep holding me back, but I am determined to ask, but then if they say yes, I don't know how well I'll do there, it seems like a lot of people and I keep getting a pull away from it, I'll still go if they say yes, if anything because Ethan is there, but we'll see. Then I'm also worried about my glasses having an incorrect PD, and the process of returning it, it'll all be sorted out in its own time I believe. ..And then there's the seed dinner, and like, it seems like a hassle, RN I'm just gonna take things one step at a time

    Entry: Estoy cansadddddoooooo, cansadísimo, I didn't have a ton of classes today cause no Dr bani Taan - went on some trip with Andreh and simon, played a bit of beat saber, with my.brunken wrist lol. It was.celebrate.spirit.so.classes were moved. RN I feel really tired of socializing lol, it feels like the part of my brain that handles other.people just.burnt out, I'm sure, I think I'll be more sociable tomorrow, we'll see, this was the first programming quiz to memory that got me worried, but thank God I believe I pulled through. I did some more blender-ing and I'm pretty happy with my progress!..One thing that does annoy me is tht I didn't set my PD in my glasses, so there's a chance that they'll be tough to adjust to, but I mean, que será será, I already ordered it. There's a seed dinner tomorrow that I sleepily said I'll go to, and I'm gonna tell my parents about fall getaway..Off to bed

    Entry: I should add blender-ing on here, I essentially staryed my day on it, and I enjoyed it a fair amount, tomorrow I'll work on the chair, if we go on campus early, I'll just go to class and do it there, and bring the mouse with me too, I was doing that as I was watching world trigger too. Then went on campus, Lin alg class, boring and typical, went to workout, great workout! Tapered off at the end as I didn't do all my exercises, skipped chinups cause hand. And didn't finish hyperextensions cause back :*), Ive been feeling huge and well rounded lately which is sweet ..4 beard hairs still there loll. New glasses come on the 19th! Seems so far away 😭. That's about it for today, I worked a bunch on tama, and made some good progress, apart from freezes in deployment, but that's a tomorrow me problem lolll, I'm liking how it Is turning out, and after this I'm gonna be doing some work on Google earth engine!

    Entry: I am pretty, conflicted, to write this, mostly cause a lotta little different things happened today that kinda add up, I'll go sequentially. It was raining ! So I woke up to rain which is a plusss, I decided to wear my stompin boots and I don't regret the decision, it made/makes me feel powerful lol. So didn't do much at home and went to school for Dr bani Taans class, now he knows my birthday and that I just recently turned 18 lol. ..Went to Dr pickell which was nice, then went to Cru, we had a lotta new people! And I was leading lol, I think it went decently well, I messed up some parts I believe, it was hard to stay engaged and follow peoples opinion while reading the document, but it turned out well, the food was good, I met a dude named noble, he's cool and i have his number now, he also works out and is pretty jacked. I'm curious to know more about him tho. Jean had to like take a picture for a segment in Fox news which is cool, he knows one of the weather people personally, after Cru, I chilled in. The library and did some work, then went to ta, there's a new ta called Omar, and this old dude was there! Like professor level old, but it was cool to guide him, Benjamin Rosenberg was his name. Dr bani Taan looked at me as I was helping him debug and he looked happy when everything was sorted out ..I wonder what/who he sees in me. Apart from that tho, uhhh I worked out after, Noble was there, he trains, hard! Like I see him struggling to push the weight and like going to failure, it definitely pushed me to train harder, but I couldnt afford to go to failure on exercises like the bench press, on dumbbell row maybe yeah, my cardio was definitely still limiting me, but it's better! My arm definitely hurts more now 😭😭, tomorrow is leg day which is fine, but I'm definitely backing down from movements that strain the muscle , gonna maybeput an ice.pack on it too periodically...Anyway just didn't resist temptation, and the cru session I led was on resisting temptation ;-;, yeah ;-;, also I responded to Richard about being able to make it to the tbingy on Saturday and I hoope I'm getting paid, I've officially run out of spending gift card money xd..Oh after the gym I got a strawberry smoothie and Ben And I worked on the stats homework. Got it finished too woo!!! I feel a bit bad about excluding Andre.  ..I did a tiny chunk of productive work on tama and I was hoping to deploy it fully today but we'll see tomorrow ..I also got 4 beard hair!

And a bit of a bonding moment, especially mini golf, we first went out to eat which was pretty nice, okay food, went pretty full, then we window shopped a teensy bit at Walmart, I got two new shirts for the Jim!! Then we went to the universal non stop arcade! We first tried the rock climbing, me and my younger brother and it was sweet, I got the hard one but couldn't do the extra hard 🥹, then we went to the go-karts, which were insanely fast!!!! Like it'd be so easy to crash those what the hek, ..That pose of me in the picture is at such an awkward angle 🥹😂, then I got on a call with Ben, AND HE THINKS ANDRE IS GAY, Or at least bi 😂😂, that was an hilarious conversation all stemming from Dr pickell!!!!, which speaking of which, I got a 21/20, on my draft and he gave me a comment saying best in class 🥹🥹🥹. Then ben ruined it by saying not to tell Andre and what if Dr pickell found out, and now it does tense me up a bit, I'm not losing sleep over it, I'm boutta fall asleep rn lol..World trigger is pretty good! Back to the weekday tho, I survived titan fest baby!

    Entry: Just coming back from school and appreciating how much I've kept up with journalling and how it has helped me, I was just reading myself saying I don't feel mature enough to be 16, but now I'm 18 and I feel weirddddd, I feel different, like when I say I'm 18, which is weird 😭, but I do! Maybe when I'm 20, I'll be reading this and feel just as weird!!! Well here's to, God willing, another lot more years of feeling weird about feeling old, I feel like 19 isn't as big of a year as 18 tho, idek what else new i can do at 18, overrated age, wouldn't recommend lol. My dad is driving me back from school, so I don't have to wait for my brother, and I just finished grading intro to prog lab tests, except I can't attend on Thursdays because of intro to Software engineering!!!!! 🥹🥹. ..Had a pretty great workout tbh, felt pumped, did 205 for reps on incline despite sore chest and bruised arm. Ate a LOT today tho, a ton , mostly unhealthy but delicious, wuteva, I have linear algebra homework to do, data mining got a new assignment which I finished pretty quickly, we had a quiz in dr mina and i got 11, Ben got 12, I totally wasn't salty loll. I have another idea for hound, specifying how many pages it should go for the comprehensive search. ..I do feel genuinely different, right now I'm kinda thinking of what I have left to do, I'm just waiting for Titan fest to be over, the thing with planning foods drains me when I think about it, so I don't wanna think about it, I've been through so much worse, sometimes I feel like 15 year old me had it more together than now year old me, but I know that's a dang lie 😭😭,..Today was fun in general, spent a lotta time with the duckateers, we were hungry and chris or Kris offered us pizza! It was good pizza!!cold but good, and I found out that my gift card works on the fitness center place, so I got me another peach smoothie, #basic 😭..I'm gonna look more into Google earth engine for our project since that's less complicated, Dr bani Taan didn't give us the greenight, also idk if I mentioned already but I've put 1500 images here!!! One day I'm gonna make an ai off all this data

And I gotta get Christian into Cru, didn't resist ;-;, might try going to a long one again. Comp sec was terrible as usual, I'm back to programming in node, I prefer go in some ways like autocomplere without typescript or having to worry about imports and errors, gos nicer that way. ..Apparently we are going to an arcade type place on Sunday after eating. Honestly, idk,I'm not superrrrrrr excited cause I feel like it's for children, but idk and I'm just being a square 😭..Also found a weird book in the library, also I was happy to see Christian

    Entry: First day as an adult 😭, how does it feel, yes I know 18 is just an age etc etc, my mum was very excited lol, I guess she's in a good mood, Ben wore an only gains shirt that was like a play on only fans and Dr pickell recognized it and it was hilarious, Cru was hilarious as well, I might put great as my mood, I also ta ed for Dr bani Taan! And he said I can still ta for him, I just have to track my hours, and I graded the students, and grading noshin was tough 😭😭, gave her a 96..Honestly today was.pretty great, I had a nice workout and there was this mustached dude, he was about to fail on Bench press and I stopped for a bit while like trying to see if he got it or not, slightly, but I think from his pov he might've thought that I was looking out for him directly, part of me just wanted to get weight I think lol, then afterwards he was like I'm strong, and I was like nahh, bench did feel, heavy? I guess, but I am definitely stronger in it and I felt it in my pec, speaking of which I wanna rewatch I think one of NHs videos about chasing numbers, welp, didn't find any, but that's fine 😭 lol, the stimulus was enough and I felt it enough that I know the workout did something, and I'm no longer training for strength, gotta keep that in mind. ..I'm feeling tired rn tho, and hot, so hot 😭😭, luckily there are 2 fans on me..I did wake up in the middle of the night with terrible stomach ache last night 😭, that's something

But! I am feeling not very excited, the general aura isn't very exciting tbh, but I don't wanna do the same thing 13 year old me did and not tell anyone till it was too late, even though I really want to 😭😭..Luckily didn't have an acso call, tomorrow might be a pretty busy day. Itd be hilarious in class tomorrow if a Prof asked for my birthday and im like, its today xD, finished season one of the OA, almost made me cry , some cringe tbh, but good cringe, then started a show called sense8..Also I'm not authorized to work so I gotta tell Dr bani Taan mañana ;-;

I played some sky with nyny and it was nice, the Halloween area is grandeee...Like idk how much I can keep up with this, my brain feels like it's operating at 50 percent cause the other 50 percent is like AaAAAaA, in other news tho, I finished ping pong the animation I think it was called, honestly pretty good anime with pretty good story and pretty good characters!..I'm looking to do some blender-ing tomorrow, along with starting my writing of the technical writing paper. I started my online Tamagotchi project but I'm not as hyped about it as I was for hound and I've gotten to a pretty good place in that :(, idk maybe the front end isn't doing it much for me anymore, or maybe I.Just don't have e a good plan. In other news, tomorrow acso meets..Oh also made pizza, well, made ground beef and grated cheese on pizza

    Entry: I think today's the longest I've gone! At least in years, I just spent like 30 mins on reddit totally not forcing myself to not tempt myself 😭. I had a pretty good workout today tho, only one class and Ben and I finished stats homework which was great, we spent a lotta time together today tbh, I really enjoyed myself when playing pool with Andrew Allen ( who's cracked at pool ) and kenyae. It was hilarious cause I didnt know how to do it but was learning bit by bit, we win some we lose some..And snapp that reminded me to join the sand volleyball team that Andrew said I should sign up for xD, just made them have 8 players, so I guess mission accomplished? ..Oh! I texted Christian and he has COVID! But I think he's getting better, and we just chatted for a lil bit. Apart from both of that, nothing much happened today, tomorrow imma try to get started on the technical writing work..Oh started this ping pong anime that's actually pretty good, I like it better than Haikyuu at least

And he thinks of himself as one 😭,  comp sec really riled him up, but I'm gonna look more into the you suck at subnetting stuff by network chuck, I haven't told my mum yet about the online form stuff and I feel the tension slightly, like she remembers but doesn't want to remind me and knows that I remember but don't want to remind her, I just want to talk to Dr bani Taan first, I'm off to bed tho, gonna read the bible, play some sky, yeh, aviary is out!!

    Entry: Okay I do feel a lot better now, I pushed myself to talk to Andy about it and he essentially echoed all my thoughts from my journal, well, most of them, but it was still nice to share them with someone, I'll talk to Dr bani Taan tomorrow, but the forms are no longer in person and he has to put the job on handshake and then from there I'll be able to apply and fill out the non work study form I imagine, fun :*). ..About feeling scared, I was feeling scared about rushing my parents, and a bit of regret mixed in too, cause my mum was asking me about the necessary documents etc etc and I didn't want to rush them. What is done is done though, ..Also something else fun happened lol, "fun", lol right now I'm having a convo with Ethan about eye colors cause abbie - from Cru- eyes were so cool looking, but computer security was a REAL class, like the class went from 0 to 100 superrr quick, I was at the Cru cidar and donuts which was fun! And listened in on the class for the syllabus portion, then he started teaching and i was like nooope, we dived head first, gonna watch some YouTube videos about the topic but the research I did when setting up my server definitely helped ..Just got home tho, I'm spending more and more time on campus, also helped Andy put up posters and my legs are sooo sore. Gonna end today watching YouTube prolly, just to get some basic knowledge on the computer security stuff, the class is definitely going to be challenging and part of me is really excited, like he goes super fast and says stuff expecting that we know it, but we don't 😭, and I guess we just have to keep up

    My mood bad
    
    Entry: Ughhhhhhhh I'm feeling very frustrated, very frustrated, well, mostly frustrated, and annoyed, especially cause it's my mum giving the advice and it's sane advice and it's annoying, like so annoying, I'm half crying, but I'll go into more details, I'm hoping on talking with Andy about this. Okay so it started with Dr bani Taan approaching me - sending me an email about being a TA for his intro to programming class, which is great!! I'm gonna try to stay grounded in the present and take thing step by step because I had a moment of feeling very very frustrated. ..Okay so I agreed to it, and he was like great, get the non work study form, yeah filling forms is usually the catalyst, side note though, his class was great and hilarious. So I did some internet digging and there's no non work study form online, even used hound which was great lol. Then I just came to the conclusion that I'll ask my parents, so I asked my mum about it and she was talking about how the process was long and she's still trying to get done with mofes stuff, which means that if it's the case that I need an SSN, I won't be able to TA, and then I felt like there were more efficient ways to get things done, but she's using the same process as for mofe, which I suppose did work, so I decided that that's okay. Then I was talking about how I felt like all my effort was being going to waste, going out of my way go get opportunities and being personally asked, only to have to shut them all down. ..Now is where I felt annoyed, not just with myself, mostly with myself, but also with God,which is stupid. My mom was bringing up points like everything so far has being God and that God is behind me being recognized and like everything good that has happened so far and it's all up to process, and I kept being like, but I'm the one putting in the work, but she said that even if I put in the work, there are people who put in the work but never get recognized, and that God is leading the path and opening opportunities for me. ..And I felt, so frustrated, thats the perfect word, first with myself, because all this time I've been feeling like I've been doing everything myself, like I didn't even know my true feelings till I said it, I had mentioned that why would I even be motivated to go out of my way to get people to attract me with opportunities, and she was like God is the one that brings the opportunities, and she is very right, so first I felt frustrated at myself for feeling like I was the one in charge all along and that God wasn't working to help me all through it, then I got angry at God, sad lol, because idk, i felt alone, like God isnt a physical person with me guiding me, and why is it that im being given all these opportunities only to have them be dashed away. Which, I'm still jumping the gun, nothing has been decided yet, but I felt like I had absolutely no control in anything, and now I just feel like cru hasn't taught me anything, like everything is logical, leave everything to God because he is the one in control, but I never really put that into action and it's showing now, I guess we all grow the most in times of trouble. Like I really was close to crying at the moment cause of how frustrated I felt. Now it has passed and Im seeing things with clearer eyes, but now I don't know if I can ever actually let go of the reigns, idk if I'm hardening my own heart..There's still a part of me that feels like I left a lot unsaid and wants to get out, but I don't know how true those feelings will be, and I don't even know what I feel in my heart, like when I write here, I go with my brain, logic, but at moments like that where I wasn't thinking logically and just spoke, 1) I felt out of place because I usually never just speak, the thought about me putting all the work and there being no reason to stand out if this will just be the end of everything, felt very new to me,..Okay so first step, calm down, let's first take a look at the good in the day, data mining class was hilarious and it looks like we will be learning great things, with people I really enjoy being around, then technical writing was also great, Prof pickell is fun, cusses and is pretty informal, which is cool, Dr mina is a joy as always, even though the class is different, and Rami is in our class!! With his sister!!!!! Flip I forgot her name but I can look back at it in blackboard. I had an okay workout, got all my work done, except for technical writing reading, will do that tomorrow, Cru went well..Ok deep breathes, first thing I realize is that God is the one doing everything, and idk, that makes me feel weak, like everything I do is small, maybe because it is really small, or are my actions that significant, lol I'm not going to go into a depressive episode, I hope, but my mum was right in the sense that God is the one providing all those opportunities, and he's the one that brought us here, I would've had none of the opportunities if not fo r him. These are things I have no control over, do I even have control over anything?..I think I can only go so far by myself and would like to talk to Andy about it, like does what I do matter, should I even try, a part of me just wants to give into the nihilistic view, but then again I enjoy asking questions and going beyond in a class, sure I feel bad about disappointing Dr bani Taan but it's not something in my control and I'm sure he knows it. I can always talk to him in his office after I get the paper. Ik logically from Cru that we are to accept that Christ is the one leading everything, but now I'm just very confused as to what my role is in all this, a part of me is also imagining God being malevolent against me for some reason, and a very very small part of me that I am trying to snuff out, the lurking doubt, the lurking annoying doubt that'll only go away with proper information, and research that I can do, and will start, is imagining that all of this is for nought if God doesn't even exist, but God exists, I'm still working to be able to say that with no doubt in my heart...This entry is getting very long, so I'll cut it off there, I don't think I'm in the mood for sky today, or a full Bible reading, maybe tomorrow I'll have a clearer head and re read through this, I really do want to talk to Andy tho.

    Entry: Pretty good day! First and only class went pretty well, Dr zhong is super nice in person. Started the day off with a workout, there were a decent amount of people! But still worked out nicely, felt drowsy tho! Gonna eat something light next time. Tomorrow leave not too early so I have enough time. ..I'm still working on hound and I'm getting super excited for it and having a nice almost final product that others can use, even if no one uses it, it's still sweet seeing it come to life! Somehow more so than an actual website, well, maybe, maybe not, but just seeing it run feels me with joy xD. ..Back to sequential, finished working out, went to Lin alg with Ben and Andre, apparently my brother is in the class as well ;-;, I made a realization that I'm a bit too lazy to put on here but I'm not letting him live in my head rent free 😭, I really missed the library! Oh! I also stopped by to help at Crus recruiting stuff, but they got in trouble 🥹🥹, but everything got resolved! ..Skipping time, did linear alg homework and spent some time in the library again, then went to do cardio at like 7 15, waited for my brother to get a ride, then we went by the student union and found josephene, stopped by to chat with her and I feel dumb for acting awkward around her just cause she's Andres gf 😭😭. Anyways ignoring that, went home, watched Futurama and worked on hound, the names so cool too 😭, and now I'm here typing this. Tomorrow's gonna be a busy ish day, I'm really looking forward to data mining and intro to software engineering though!!! Not as much technical writing. ..I think that's about it for me tho! Cardio was nice, torture but nice, and I didn't feel drained after, in fact felt energized, then tired, then slightly energized again lol..Also returned my key woo!

Birthday is in a week, dang time is linear isn't it 😭😭, stayed in bed for the greater chunk of the day except to eat or play IEYTD, and speaking of ieytd, finished it, didn't expect it to be done so quickly 😭😭😭😭, the last mission was flipping amazing, anx the story, I felt so bad for the "villain" 😭. ..Anyways tho, did a bit of work on previously doc-find, now hound, and now it stores the urls the user already queried and uses namespaces to separate their storage, which is kewllll. I might add a flag to force re add ing documents and a flag to make the env variables easy to set up on other devices. I stumbled on the namespaces feature and honestly don't know how I would've gone about storing the db if not for doing the gophercises and learning about boltdb. ..Did some driving practice tests again. Ready to get back to working out tomorrow!! Early in the morning🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹. I think that's the first thing I'm gonna do wooo, also only have one class tomorrow..Also continued full metal alchemist

    Entry: Putting it as great cause hapi, started off pretty okay, slept weird but good sleep! Resisted temptation which was shocking to even me. I gotta put the goal back on here, note to self, temptation is temporary and I shouldn't let the strong feelings win!  I am really hoping that I can remember that most of the day, I'll be okay. The afternoon of the day was great too, I was able to get langchaingo working! Not as great as the JavaScript implementation , but I'm happy with it. I still have some features I wanna implement and I don't want to leave it half cooked! Gonna stay with it. I'm enjoying go and I was able to make a sweet command line out of it using pterm as well. ..Showed it to pise and he got excited about it which was kewl! I'm also pretty curious about vector databases and ive been ruminating over doing the Tamagotchi project for a while now, we'll see we'll see. I might make a blender model too , it would incorporate a lot of what I'm learning/leaning to learning. I haven't built a webserver in go in a while, or used Vue in a while, or even react for that matter. Well whatever I learned before can be easily learned again. Well, can be learned again ..Then I just finished semi binge watching the Titan transport thingy on their YouTube channel and saw Al and Al harith and James and Andrew. Then was watching some funny nollywood videos with Ben, they are HILARIOUS. Just.hilarrious, now I'm on the john writing here xD. Also did a few more driving tests, got some wrong but that's how I'll learn. I've passed all of them so far, some coming close, like 84%, but I'm learning! I'll be taking more and more and I think I'll also retake till I can consistently get 100, I have enough time. God willing that is. One thing I learned today faith wise and I kept trying to remember is to not quench the flesh, it's a never ending cycle 😭, also I'm learning how to be better at praying, it helps when I think of an outcome I want and then the words usually flow. ..Thats all for today tho, tomorrow I'll try to add the continuous feature to the langchain go. I'm hoping to see if I don't have to constantly add documents. Apart from that, I still have the react course on the back burner. We'll see how it goes. I'm not trying to crowd my plate especially since the new semester is just getting started, I just got a teensy bit overwhelmed but I just have to take things one step at a time and I'll find my way. Pretty long entries this week, or month tbh..Oh also finished no game no life, great anime with great hype moments

    My mood Nostalgic
    
    Entry: I had a big moment of nostalgia today, and idk why but I feel like I haven't written here in a long time. We lost power for the majority of the day but my phone was still charged thanks to the powerbank. And sky broke the world record!! 1.25 million players at the same time and 10000 people in the same server!..I watched the entire concert and enjoyed it, there was no electricity, well already said that, so I made a quick breakfast, then another breakfast of Mac and cheese with baked beans, amazing combo, and decided to find a book to read. The book was, unsatisfying, grossly unsatisfying lol, it was a collection of stories And I read the first story and that was just, blech, but It made me feel so sleepy and I took a nice, which looking back the feeling of utter sleepiness felt nice, but waking up wasn't as nice, felt groggy and had to adjust to everything XD. ..Then mum brought pizza so I ate that, and then chilled till the electricity came back on! U was fully expecting to wait till Sunday night but thank God we have electricity again, even though I did enjoy the "disconnecting not really disconnecting" time. I also was looking through the old mind builders pictures and the wave of nostalgia, hence the nostalgic mood hit me, and it's still hitting me a bit, specifically im interested in seeing what happened to mofifoluwa. I don't remember his last name tho, a lotta them have no digital footprint 😭😭..Anyways tho, after the lights came back on, I tried to tackle langchaingo again to no avail and just asked for help in the discord channel, now hoping for the best. ..Also watched some Simpsons episodes, the usual, and did some driving test practices which have been pretty helpful in making me feel more confident, I'm trying to get down that flashing red light is the same as stop sign, and flashing yellow light means proceed with caution. Gonna keep practicing tho...Also downloads 4 pics 1 word!

    Entry: Thunderstorm, tornado watch? And being a bum for the majority of today. Started no game no life and it is hilarious. Also made oatmeal raisin cookies which weren't half bad. Hmm what else, aurora concert tomorrow! And I hope the electricity doesn't turn off 😭..Played more IEYTD and had the meeting with Dr Hill, I emailed the dude who made langchaingo and he responded!! But imma respond to him tomorrow lul, then gonna join the DC server and hope for help there. The lights are flickering and I'm hoping they dont go off 😭..I didn't do much coding today, I really want a break before classes start back up again. Today's journal would be shorter, didn't resist temptation twice! ;-;, and Ethan's car got hit. Off to bed before the lights go out!

    Entry: Semi tired semi not tired, saw a lotta people I knew today, even Christian was there and he interrupted this girl from a club I was talking to 😭😭, she looked so irritated lol. IEYTD had a super fun but stressful driving mission which kinda eased my worries about driving. I did some coding and trying to figure out how langchaingo works, only a lil bit of success 😭😭. ..Didn't do any react tho, my time has been focused on go. Also Michael said I looked more jacked, I guess the please don't make me do stuff t-shirt accentuatesi them, I also wore my super comfy sweatpants. Then Simon felt my pecs xD. Not Simon yeldo, biology Simon, the anime.club was there and Andre too which was.coool. I started and finished another anime called another Loll, it was so dark and a bit confusing but good overall. ..Hmm what else what.else. Cru was also there. We got the printing stuff sorted out. So RN I'm just happy that everyone worked out and the rest of the week is bum mode me. Apart from meeting with Dr Hill tomorrow to talk about seed stuff

    Entry: Tomorrow, we go on campus! But at like 5, so I have enough me time, I'm not nervous about it really. Also, I didn't have to go on campus!! At first it bugged me so much, then Michael came.through, then oriekaose had a break and could print it himself, crisis resolved!!!  ..I do hope that it hasn't affected how he sees my work ethic, which is a weird statement, me seeking validation 😭, but I do hope it doesn't affect how he sees me working with him as VP, I don't think it does, and it's dumb for me to worry about stuff like this. I'm definitely not losing sleep over it, but I find myself questioning it. ..Dangit I was about to say sth but forgot, okay I semi take it back? I'm a bit nervous about tomorrow, I get tiny moments of the, impending stress moment, very very tiny moments, but they're there, and usually go in a flash lol...Speaking of go! Lol nah not yet, but I asked Dr Hill to help me pay off my balance and I hope it's done quickly, I'll have like 7k, should be more tbh 👀, with my parents. I'm not keeping track and idk if I'll ever explicitly collect it, don't need it so doubt it, and I could always amass the money for a car when necessary...Oh I remember, I read till page 30 of what every driver must know, first i pass the written test God willing, then I get a temporary instruction permit and practice driving for 30 days, then I can take the driving test. And there is a point system, 6 is for serious things like intoxication, 2 is 10mph and below of above the speed limit, 3 is 11 to 15. 4 is intoxication, 3 also has some school bus stuff I believe, 2 is also refusing breathalyzer, lol trying to do a quick review. ..Then I tried making some meatball! But the meat thingy was too mushy and it wasn't great 😭, but the meatballs actually tasted fine, reminiscent of tdr meatballs. Maybe a bit salty, tis alright tho, first try. Dad went to school but came back early. ..This is a very disorganized journal, but I also caught up on Futurama and found an old episode I didn't watch hehe. Then time for the fun part...I'm enjoying building a command line app! Building doc-find with go and langchain, and I hope I can get langchain fully working, then I'll be able to pretty everything up with pterm. I think I'll be making more in the future, I can already see myself using it..Didn't do much blender today, or the react course, really did want to take the day off to relax, but I feel better when I'm productive..That's about it for today tho, gonna ask my brother about going with him, but then again my mum will be there as well, omg I feel like throwing up, I had so much soup - mum. Made catfish soup, it was good, but I had so much aaa. see ya later

    Entry: Today was fun! Went to Andy's house and the cru bonfire, it was great seeing Ethan and talking to others again. Also weird being in Andy's house xD. My knickers tore 😂😭, and luckily only oriekaose I think noticed. I felt pretty normal to be honest most.of the day, but there was a point where I went in alone to take more food and it was so serene and I felt like out of my self, like I was on autopilot, or just in the backseat lol, there was no actual bonfire, but all in all it was great, dang I didn't take any.pictures! ..But apart from that, I'll also have to be on campus on Wednesday for the actual org fair. Technical writing Prof released the syllabus and some other things, and oriekaose wants me to come on campus to help print some more posters but idk if Ill be able to/really want to spend all that time on campus, I'm campus burnt out 😭😭. He'll be helping freshmen move in tho

    Entry: I had a bunch of weird dreams , the weirdest but most fun was that lil Tay I think is her name was having a party about becoming/being a dude, and it was so bizarre, but I found some of my friends from vicsum and mind builders, Sola and subomi were there, but subomi said that wasn't his name and he didn't remember me, but another dude which I can't remember said he was also doing web dev in front end at northern something school and Dr mina also taught him, then I got excited and everyone around me was laughing..Omg another dream was that I was trying to get into a shop to sell something, but the person was trying to stop me so I broke through the barricade, but they had a snake as a weapon, so I agitated the snake and it bit them, then I started trying to chase the snake and finally killed it and then I dialed 911 and they asked for an emergency phone and I couldn't type it for the life of me, so I just hung up, but eventually the crime scene got cleared by idk what...There were some other small dreams in between and after, but those were the stand outs. Today is the day, and Ill be lying if I said I wasn't nervous, but then again I'm always slightly nervous at best when doin new things, and this one isn't bad nervous, well nervous and excitedness are the same emotion I suppose, well I'm not nervous nervous, but I keep imagining how things would go so the struggle is keeping myself grounded in the present

    Entry: Today was a rushed day! Started off early ish, did chores and showered pretty quickly, then donned my Hawaiian shirt and shorts and glasses and I didn't look half bad!  I'm gonna be shopping for aviators soon enough though, and circle glasses, and a glasses case 😭..Also just found out fall comes after summer, not winter 😭, but fall is still cold so im fine with that. Tomorrow's the big day! I'm not stressed and don't regret deciding to go, actually I'm pretty excited! Once I learn to drive ,I won't have to be worrying around transportation and that'd be sweet, best start speeding up the pace lol. ..Back to how my day went, went shopping!! And it was fun, then I got thirsty and tired, then we got dunkins! And I drank water at home. Got a ton of cool clothes, like 3 tshirts and 3 joggers! One winter coat, actually 4 shirts, the Cera ve lotion I've been procrastinating on getting, and a perfume for post workout! I'm gonna be working out early and have some early classes 😭, so yeah. ..Towards the end of shopping, Ben introduced me to langchain, and I was looking at it and it looked pretty cool, it helps websites work with openai and llms in an easy enough way, I was able to set it up pretty easy, do the tutorial and get a pretty cool command line app going, my plan is to get a url from the user and then parse everything related to that url, and from there, the user would be able to ask any questions about any documentation they have, but one step at a time xD , then I was curious and found an open source tool that I set up so that i could create put in PDFs and I'll be able to ask questions from the PDF, which was cool and vector databases are fast! I'm kinda curious as to how they work...Then I kept thinking about what other tools I didn't know about in terms of good ai apis, and then I did a teensy bit of research and didn't find anything 🥹🥹, but that's fine, ill keep discovering things organically, for now langchain is in my repertoire and I can even use it for the senior design project, sweet, or even, you know it, YUI! ..Also an online Tamagotchi, it has been an idea at the back of my mind for a while but I haven't had the brain power to think of how it would work, now I sort of do with langchains agents. Didn't do much work with anything else today though...The plan for tomorrow? My dad's not going to work so I'll be a bit limited, but going with the flow should work, the next gophercise is a command line tool that looks interesting so I can continue that, along with the reaxt course and blender, then go to school and design poster, then go to bonfire, then God willing I'll be back here by Monday night and let you know how things went!..Apart from just recaps on how my day went tho, I had a moment ironing my clothes where I was thinking about the past and got the bad nostalgia feeling again, then it hit me how the time that has passed will never return, then I started to slightly worry about being super old and realizing my time ran out, then I comforted myself in thinking about religion and the end isn't really the end, then I was wondering if I enjoyed religion for religion and the beliefs versus the comfort it gave me in knowing death is essentially not final. ..I've definitely not being very faithful over the last few week/weeks/break. Lust primarily, pride definitely, getting pinecone and the pdf document thing working was definitely a source of pride and showing the project to Ethan and ben was another

    Entry: Pretty chill day, started early with some chores - cleaning the walls to make the place look nicer and I got carried away while listening to aurora lol. Then played some IEYTD and made the decision to start learning to drive 🥹, I'm not gonna lie I do feel overwhelmed and feel like I'm not gonna be able to pass the exam, and I try to remember all the dumb people in r/idiotsincars who got licenses and then I feel bad for trying to make myself feel better by belittling others in a way that doesn't help either of us lol, not necessarily feel bad, but I do truly feel like saying dumb people have licenses as well Is weird, or maybe I'd just be dumber than them lol, but then I settle down and know I'm overreacting, just gotta center myself and take things one step at a time. ..Anyways tho! Did some blender uv unwrapping, it was hella tedious with a lotta steps but I'm slowly familiarizing myself with blender and trying to slowly make better scenes. Found a good playlist, then gonna start seeing how to import other people's stuff etc etc. Idk just like a fun hobby, I don't want to put too much stock into it, but I do enjoy making something pretty and then showing it to others. Going shopping tomorrow tho, gonna bring a lotta money, gonna have a closet redo woo! Also hoping to get glasses. ..Apart from the blender stuff, I learned a bit more about go, this time about runes, people keep saying things are easy to learn in golang and I'm not necessarily finding that to be the case, but I can only do what I can, and I can learn piece by piece and ignore the fluff - others experiences are different from mine, and that's fine. I'm not coping I promise xD, but I learned about runes and how they're used in go to help in working with utf8 characters, compared to a typical ASCII encoding which is just 1 byte, runes are an alias for an int32 type, as in they can store 4 bytes to accommodate for bigger strings, and we have the Unicode package to help in working with runes. I honestly don't mind digging deeper into lower level stuff like this, I really wanna get to know golang and get good at it, kinda same with react, I'm more in touch with my learning of the programming language versus my time with Vue, especially cause I'm doing go without a course, the experience is pretty different, I'm finding myself learning different parts of it every day, organically, rather than have someone else tell me about them, and I kinda enjoy the experience, makes me feel like I'm getting to know go as a person more and more lol. ..Also didn't have the call with Dan 😭, and omaran texted me about working with him on a url shortener with ads but honestly, I don't want to, I'm semi ghosting him right now till I work up the courage to tell him that working on it with Andre would be the better choice as itl get both of them familiar with their learning styles etc. I'll do that tomorrow, also fall getaway here I come! Future me don't back down, please 😂😭, speaking of faith, mines been very very shaky lately, stoopid brain 😭, it's my fault and being a lazy Christian tbh, I'm glad Cru is gonna be starting back up. Gonna read a chapter tonight. I think that's all for today tho, I played some beat saber at night and had a ton of fun, watched old Simpson episodes too. Overall a pretty good day!

    Entry: Honestly today was a pretty chill/relaxed day and the time went by quickly and slowly. Woke up at like 9, latest all week cause I slept late 😭, and we'll wasn't home alone so felt out of the loop again, but just decided to do lo que me pegó la gana, so I started by making pizza! Good pizza. Did the camel case lesson in golang and mantas gave me access to an S3 storage - simple storage service, I keep forgetting what it means xD, but that demystified me hearing about Amazon s3 storage, which is great! And I used golang to communicate with it to try to crash the server lol, didn't work tho :( but I learned more about wait groups and go routines, wait groups allow us to wait till multiple go routines are finished, pretty cool, but I didn't get to do nun with channels. I was happy with being able to understand/keep track of the go code tho ..It was pretty dang easy. Then I played hubris, then more hubris, finished the game!! It was a great game, red matter 2 left me more speechless tho, now I can play IEYTD 3 in happiness!!!  Gonna start early tomorrow lol. Then continued on the react course and did the challenge myself, use reducers are pretty convenient and it solidified understanding using it when multiple operations can be run with a piece or pieces of state. Then some more chilling overall, watching and laughing to Bob's burgers, Simpsons sprinkled around, I'm glad i was able to break my silence about the bonfire woo Ara! Hmm then sky had a dress rehearsal which I did not know about!! There were so many people in the servers, but gonna wait till next week :D. And now I'm in the toilet 😂, well on the toilette..Apart from all that tho, I also worked a bit on dev tools and getting the sort and liking feature to behave properly, the sort feature was relatively easy, but keeping track of the likes with local storage made me have to pause Bob's burgers ;0, it was another challenge with react that I hadn't faced yet, another thing when it comes to backend stuff is that, well even coding stuff in general is that I'm getting too tied in into thinking there's a right way and a wrong way of doing things, like I was trying to imagine how a like dislike feature with uses will work and I kept shooting down the ideas I came.up with thinking there'd be better solutions, there probably might be, but theres no right way of doing anhthing and ill only learn if i fail, or at least ill learn better. Breh autocorrect is broken..But yeah I tried to create a custom hook but it didn't work out very well so I just did everything normally. ..I might refactor it sometime down the line, maybe tomorrow? Just to practice, but I made a wild guess on the code and it worked - setting the initial state as a callback, I still have to get used to the rendering behavior of react and think of things in the react way, so I had to first check if the user had liked the post in the local storage, and if they did update the liked state. So that's something I could do better, first define the problem I'm looking to solve, then the steps to solve it, explicit steps, like a) check if the post id is in the local storage...if it is, update the likes to be true...if the user likes, remove or add to local storage as needed. Stuff like that, the more practice I get with react, the better I'll be, so I'm not super bummed and at least I'm getting exposed to newer and newer scenarios, so in summary, practice makes progress?

    Entry: Okay so pretty good today tbh, not rad per se, if the donut worked, maybe 😭, killed 3 wasps, they feel me with such anger 😭😭, it made me pour the baking powder, well, I'm blaming the wasp but I definitely could've paid more attention. ..Anyways tho, did the statistics webwork assignment and I was looking at the source code and found the formula for one of the questions with a comment about a savvy student gaining access 😂, I was so hyped, I started digging into their code base and, aAnd I used knowledge from my HTB days! Using go buster! Didn't find anything, mostly, but it was cool to dig around. ..Also made a mug and a tree in blender, just to test things out and they turned out okay. Talking with Ethan about Andy stuff, and I gotta ask if I can go to their house!!! Gotta pump myself up aaaa, then gotta ask ACSO about our meeting, double aaaaa, also shared dev tools with pise and mantas

    Entry: Pretty productive day today if I do say so myself, killed 2 wasps, for sure didn't miss those xD, made.meat pie but didn't make the filling myself, it was good, like pretty good but the meat pie taste, I've had so many now that it's like, blech 😭. ..Also did another gophercise parsing html and I did learn some things, like bariatric functions or functional options, I'm also not gonna worry too much about the inner workings of servehttp, just gonna be using handlefunc. At the end of the day might even use a framework like chi. Then did more react stuff, understanding when use reducers would be helpful, like when we have a piece of state that can undergo multiple transitions due to different events, a reducer would be great for that..Also played hubris and wow, I underestimated the game, I passed the hard part! Now I'm really.enjoying it, the story needs to be fleshened out, speaking of which, IEYTD comes tomorrow eeee, but it has stunning visuals and I loved being in the lab and making food while the story was playing out, I think it's only gonna get harder and I'm here for it tbh. ..Shared a SS with the duck and they just ignored it ofc, well not ofc, but like they've been doing that a lot and it's annoying, idk if I'm to blame, but I've just accepted it and will rather share things with the sky comm. And fitness street, speaking of which, finished three J's lesson! And I think the blender model turned out great, I have a lotttt to learn and I think I'll do some basic shapes and transformations first. Still going strong on my react x go x blender plan. I think it's all gonna spill over to the upcoming semester - Prof zhong released hw 1, just a tutorial, but still, I think ill be able to handle it tho, Ojalá que si..That's about it from me today tho, I tried a turtle neck and looked pretty good in it, I'm thinking of buying one on Sunday 👀👀..Also had a dream where I was flying in the sky world and fighting someone or something

    Entry: Almost got sucked into reddit, I don't think I was productive as I'd like, but I was productive and my standards are too high, did some videos of gophercise, removed my old site url from Google, learned about use reducers in react, they aren't that difficult but they can get complicated I'm sure, then did some blender stuff and had a meeting with Dan, the morning was so calm and quiet and cold, waiting for winter to come again , also did Les mills!...Finished 91 days, greatt anime..Also tried omurice 😭, tomorrow, we make scones!

It should not be retried.That’s all we know. our for blender video and still have plenty time during the day. Preferably I'd like to do all my learning before 4 30 and before everyone comes back. I think that's doable, wouldnt be able to chill for long but I'll have the rest of the day and would work on side projects after 4 30. ..Pretty long entry today

Gonna put that outta my mind, but look at the reddit SSs, ooop i got distracted, but didn't talk in the duck today, just lurked, like a morninglark? That made no sense, evening lark? Lol, my battery is like 15 percent and I'm using my laptop fan to keep myself cool. I'm not talking at the duck cause rn i don't feel secure enough to face them, trying to source my self worth from within, so yeah. Anyways,looking forward to the home alone times, started sth called gophercises and they're much better than AOC. Hmm, yeah I also wanna go shopping and I'm cutting me hair on Monday. ..But yeah aotta my self worth is tied to the things I do like code or muscles, before j forget, met a funny Brazilian dude in sky, have enough pictures for the next few days ..Spent too much time on my phone!! Also finished into the spider verse, pretty good tbh

Not trying to think about it now tho, just gonna stay away, then started watching Spiderman, the one with miles.morales, then the lights turned off ✨✨✨✨✨,.well half the lights, jolly fun, now I'm hot ...And my seed reunion didn't go as great as I'd love, felt self conscious, Ben said I looked skinnier than before and didn't know whether to take that as a compliment or not, then I did wear my tight shirt but felt uncomfortable a lot of the way through, just felt uncomfortable and people seeking all the way through, there were some good moments tho, we played a game that we had to put sticky notes with facts on them and stuff, I need to find a way to hose executable files online cause dumb UMDES moved their stuff to another site literally yesterday 😭😭..Left.school at like 1 tho, and watched godai=- this Spanish YouTuber that also plays sky, play journey and the game looks marvelous!..Also had a pretty long chat stream with sunny side Vue..Also finally emailed trajan!!

Hmm, worked some more on documentation, and got to print the ACSO flyers, I'm looking forward to seeing the next seed generation tomorrow, got an outfit picked out to accentuate mis musculos hehehe, is it a bit vain, maybe 😭😭🥹, but whatevs don't talk to me :hmph: lol, nah, but I am really looking forward to seeing the past seed gen, ..Apart from that tho, there's this new manga called Bones and it's pretty good, I was able to deploy dev tools to test things out and the basic features except search work, I still don't love the UI, and will look into more tweaks. ..Hmm yeah I talked about the buff dude I met earlier, Christian just talked to him out of nowhere and I would never have gotten the chance to, I suppose that's something I can learn from him, it's not going to hurt me to put myself out there - not in the dating sense, in the talk to people you want to talk to - sense. Body dysmorphia is a bum. ..I was gonna say sth dangit, didn't meet with Dan today, hmm, yeah that's all from me

    Entry: Today went from good busy - had a smol meeting with Dr Hill and he told me what to do, well I told him what I'll be doing, things were chill, ez ,then it got overwhelming busy for like a few minutes cause cru and ACSO and setting things up, then back to normal levels of busy, so Simpsons and code lol, I was beginning to feel bummed about not being able to quickly understand.how react works in terms of re rendering and found one redditor that shared my sentiments, but they got ratioed lol, but I do kinda see the point, I was at first.over complicating the code, and dang now I do see how it can help, I could've set up an abort controller on the return function so when strict mode re renders twice and every use effect gets called once on initial render, even with none empty dependency array, then it wouldn't mess up much the api calling. Then I realized that my code does not need to be 100 percent optimized or clean code, and that I'm the one implementing the stuff so I went with the dirty method to me, asked chat.gpt to clean it up and it made sense, I just needed a function, no need for.useeffects, which makes sense because I want to trigger the side effect with an actual trigger, the click,not on page load or because of something else changing, it's like trying to set an effect to watch for sth changing while that thing is changing ..Idk, I'm learning like you, gonna embrace the noob and code without paralysis by perfection, same with golang tbh, I think my basic go is getting better, practice makes perfect and practice takes time, I'm just going to keep building things and over time I'll get better and better at it, I still come across Vue stuff that I'm not used to/new coding situations, and this was definitely one of those new coding situations moments, if I skip the class based react part of the course, I'm not gonna,but if I did, I'll definitely reach the advanced portion much quicker, but slow and steady wins the race, I still have about idk, 40 hours of content, that's a lotta sweet practice!

    Entry: Feeling much better, workout was drone-y, but got it done, then went for a semi walk, went to check the times of the library, gonna set a reminder now to print out flyers, also gotta reset the reminder to email trajan, I've also been thinking more about like, myself, which sounds weird but there's rn a struggle, one part of me feels vain, and small - mentally and physically small lol, like, I'd stare at myself in the mirror and see if I look big, or compare myself to someone else and see if I stack up, childish ish behavior, ..Wow I have the same calm behavior , lol I started hearing some screams but apparently they came from nowhere, anyways, the same calm behavior id get after lifting when I first started in central and would be walking home from school, like mellow, at peace, brain semi empty type chill, and I really enjoy the feeling, idk if id have the same feeling if I didn't walk, or maybe it's from lifting, but Im still enjoying it regardless. ..Now the other side of me, wants to fight against the vanity and remember that life is honestly too short to be thinking about how much muscle I have compared to this dude, or whether my belly sticks out weird, and I hope this side wins, school of life just released a video on being simple, an oversimplified dumbing down, but its something I deeply, deeply resonated with, felt like I was doing things, not overly so, but like, things like being worried about losing GitHub streak, kinda like stupid insignificant stuff like that, a bit harsh, but yeah, ..I might go deeper into it tonight, but I may be able to bum out on Saturday cause favour can't come so we may have to do it on the weekend, which makes me feel much better, I'm realizing how much of an importance I place on the weekends as time to relax my brain, even though I still do work, but not forced work ..Also, very very good on you/me lol for turning down the journi event, because I feel like past me would've felt immensely obligated to come and I don't think it changed how Richard saw me, like, I definitely do over think cancelling out of events, but in the long run it's better for me to learn, much better. Wow feeling so calm lol, should start taking more walks. If we still end up meeting on Saturday, I'd be bummed, but I've gone through so much more and survived and even though it was unpleasant to go out of my way, speaking of which, helped Cru and asco sign up for mini org fair at ptv and part of me did feel overwhelmed but as usual, if I take everything one step at a time, I'll find my way...The remaining plan for today, I don't have much to work on on oee project so I'll make the small tweaks, send Dan my time sheet, I'll ask him first to be sure tho, then maybe some work on dev tools, nah I'll definitely work on it with the Simpsons or archer it something on, and yeah, I could die on the way back home, I pray not, so yeah here we are

    Entry: Faltan tres días chico!!! Today was pretty decent, I mean it's a day I'm never getting back, only getting older :*), but didn't walk through cobwebs this time and I attended the Dr Hill presentation on his research and finite state machine stuff and he was telling them my contributions and I felt so honored 🥺🥺🥹🥹🥹, and he also dissed Julianas organizational skills a bit, which I didn't dislike 😭, lol nah, but it's cause I had been worried that he thought I was slacking and stuff like that but I am glad that he knows that a lot of the issues weren't my fault in terms of setting things up, etc. ..I also didn't do much if any work today, did a bit more of the react course and learned more about hooks and use effect and how it runs on render plus dependency array and cleanup function type stuff, also learned about abort controllers and was able to set up mongo stuff with go, I haven't come across a big road block in go luckily, but I was also looking into the context package and then there's go routines and channels and now j feel like I'm a noob again, which I technically am, but i learn more day by day, so wuteva, i should be able to reach advanced react by the end of the week! ..Everything definitely takes practice and I'm learning more stuff about how things work behind the scenes etc etc, so thats cool, deload workout today, was a pretty lazy workout tbh :(, body's just getting a chance to recover. ..Hmm, did some Simpson and code, had a meeting with Dan too, oh he said I should send him my time stuff, but he said things were looking good so I don't mind, we have minor changes before testing the thing with the actual db, and I really do wanna see him code in go, I'm having fun, for lack of a better term lol, looking at other people's code to see how they structured things, getting data from dbs erc etc..Also met someone in chess.com who had a flcl pfp and was also Italian, talked a bit with them,..Side note, trying to get into mouseless development

    Entry: Had a dream about school starting back up again but it was a mixture of udm and vicsum students, and I was about to do the , nono in class after everyone had gone out and it was like a mixture of VR and ar experiences, also another dream in Magodo where I think we were headed to school and it was raining and my dad was waiting for me in the car as i dressed, but the vr dream was more fun, there was a game and at first i was the first one there, even added join black cat to my schedule, then a ton of people started joining and Leia was there in VR form and ife from vicsum, for some reason

    Entry: Had a dream where I was talking with pise and mantas, then also had a dream where I was playing/in sky with Betty and she was trying to pass a geometry dash type eden..Edit: ..End of the day entry, made some big progress on css tools site, like styled more of the front end and added colors, then also set up basic go server, and just finished watching Gilbert's video on a fish he caught and it's hitting me that I'm doing nothing for the environment and the kinda nostalgia from when I really did care is hitting, not very hard, but it got hands 😭, also watched some moody Simpsons episodes, was in the feels mood :*)...Played some beat saber and rn readying myself for the end of internship woo, played some chess, no big losses, but yeah like I said yesterday, today was a mostly coding and anime day, finished beastars, actually great anime, and started and finished death parade, 7/10 anime. ..Didn't do any manga reading this weekend, maybe I'll read some old chats from the wildlife buddies server

    Entry: Just finished an intense game of chess where I stalemated by like 0.01 seconds to go 😭😭, heart pounding semi victory, today was a pretty chill day, didn't bake anything, might bake sth tomorrow tho, worked a bit on riveron project and after getting to a good spot with Minim, I kept trying to come up with a new cool innovative idea and was gonna make a fitness data analyzer type thing but I just decided to go with the css project idea and maybe branch out to other fields ..Hopefully I can get enough people to contribute to it. Tomorrow tho gonna try to set up connect api mocker, just to see what's up and if it'll be possible, if I can get it done, I'd be a happy camper, then I'll work on the UI, using react, idk why but I get sad when I say I'll work on a project with react instead of Vue lol, Vue just seems very comfortable and nice, super understandable, but I gotta get used to the react way of doing things, same with golang, cause that's going on the list too. Definitely using mongo this time. ..Also gonna use the standard library again cause why not, I'm coming around to using it, I think. ..This ones backend wouldn't be too complex so Ill be fine, I was hoping to do some data visualization, maybe prep for data science class, but oh well que será será ...Watched some southpark episodes , couldn't find any good shows to start but kept going with beastars which is still pretty good. I kinda wanna use the bathroom, but it's late and I'm already comfy, speaking of comfy, j think I slept with my neck in a weird position but it's getting better, doesn't hurt when j don't think about it...Also played this game called the under presents, and I think it was more popular like 2020 ish, the idea seems so cool, I wish I was there when it just got started 🥺...Gives format bending sky cotl type vibes, speaking of which, played sky and got me dailies today..Also today is Ali, Ali razas birthday. I'm so relieved I no longer have night calls, also started the process of switching domains from .tech to .dev cause .tech is too flipping expensive..I don't have much else to say tho, tomorrow's gonna be a primarily coding and anime day, some bum mode here and there..Also idk if this is just overstating but I think my body dysmorphia, which makes it sound super serious, but has gotten worse, like, I think I'm big, well, I'm just being dumb, ignore that 🥹..Ay i haven't read in such a long time, I kinda miss it you know, I really do kinda miss it :*)

    Entry: Just finished deploying minified Minim :D, the deployment process took, hours 😭😭, but it was worth it in the end!  I've found a new service I can use to deploy MySQL databases and I improved my debugging skills when it comes to deploying, I tried with docker but gave up after it gave weird errors and tbh most of the time spent was trying to set up some free service only to figure out it wasn't remote ;-;, anyways time to start thinking of a new project tho! A dream tracker mobile app loll i almost completely forgot about snooz 😭, but I suppose I can rewrite it in sth like react native, idk. ..A part of me is motivated to work on new things cause of Ben working on new things, but im getting better at controlling myself and I am maturing enough to the point where I don't have to over push myself and can just focus on other aspects of my life, also I don't spend too much time ruminating over what I've learned, imma do some of that now tho lol , I did get a lotta stuff done with was nice, even though today was a series of weird annoying events, went on a massive chess losing streak, then a moderate sized shadow fight losing streak, then deleted shadow fight and almost deleted chess, even lost to Ethan! Unranked tho and he used a helper but still, ..But then I got to eat lunch for free, and alone! And only one week left in internship yooooo, I'm not gonna, I might not be able to get the react course done before the school year starts, but I think that's fine, I should have enough free time, gonna go back to working out in the morning, ugh so nice, I can focus on myself!!!! And then I can do cardio while the others are doing their stuff, if I choose to join them...Didn't have the meeting with Dr Hill so ended up actually like , first time literal actually doing no work! Like what even is there to do, I wanna change the start.m but need his input, no sé que hacer!  Snap I gotta play some sky and get dailies, imma do that straight after this, I don't have a lot more to say tho, I'm happy I'm done with the basics of Minim and I can go back to it later, now I can work on riveron while doing the three js course , yeah unfortunately I haven't continued on it, don't hit me 😭😭, but I get to create sth new, thinking of the css site, then adding more and more, a blog would be a good challenge..OH OH the rumble vr people responded , I debated on responding thanks but decided against it, I should tho, imma do it early tomorrow, my laptop was getting really hot, window levels hot :*), and I hope it's temporary,there's a chance it is, but if it's not, then switching distros, lol nah but I'd be pretty bummed..Gonna go play sky.now, ciaooo, speaking of which had a meeting with Dan so gonna work on some riveron stuff mañana

    Entry: Pretty decent day, didn't get any work done on research stuff today either. Had a decent workout, nothing major, played rocitizen and beat saber with Ethan and it was a decently fun time, Its super late, I didn't feel super tired, the time flew by and I wanted to get the edit feature of Minim working and it was decently easy, also did a good amount of react work today , like the course, learned about how things work behind the scene, even though I was coming across a bug with updating an object in react 😭😭 and went about it the roundabout way which luckily still works, I learned that there's the trigger, render, and commit process when it comes to rerendering components in react, this is a quick review for me lol but first an action triggers the need for a re render, there's already a virtual Dom, or fiber tree set up from the initial mount, but when the trigger is triggered, a react element tree is made, then the tree is compared to the fiber tree ina. Conciliation slash diffing process where it finds the differenxe between the two and updates accordinglh, if they have the same element but different props, only the attributes will be updated, but if they have different elements, the entire thing will be discarded and state will be reset, unless you have a unique key so that even if the element is the same but the prop to the key changes, the component would be destroyed and reverted to it's original state as well, there's also batching...I understand and can visualize the process but like anything, I just need mas practice and mas exposure...Also Andre got his VR, idk if I mentioned it before

I'm thinking of switching away from Firefox to opera, would serve me better tbh ..Told my mum how much I was getting paid and she was shocked lol

Idk, react is dumb 😭

The mimimi song is stuck in my head along with the dance, I played like 4 minutes of rocitizen in VR, haven't done dailies dang, also omaran wanted me and him to start a boot camp but I knew I couldn't go through sth like that, so I made sure to turn him down, kept in the back of my mind being like best shut it down now, also free lunch woo! He almost didn't show up, like 15 mins late, would've had to go through everything without him Xd...Imma go play sky quickly tho, sayonara..I worked more on golang and I'm understanding piece by piece, used contexts todah, request contexts and soon I wouldn't be needing to Google stuff as much!

    Entry: Neck still hurts 😭 but today was a generally good day, had work to do for the internship, taking care of the start.m file, reworking things etc, Christian wasnt here today, and I missed tdr because of the calc prof testing meeting, which I almost missed, 6 mins late 😭😭. But I had a great workout, hevy is amazing and I'm loving the rpe feature, I think this was the hardest I've pushed myself in months? Maybe more like weeks, but my triceps and biceps almost couldn't move 😂, they arre tightttt, good sore tight, and I'm working on getting better at the rep range so I can stay in it, It means having to drop in reps for inclines because 12 to 15 after a big set is hard to do 😭😭..This aint no deload week for me anymore lol, was gonna go deload but decided to test myself and it was worth ittttt...Hmm apart from that, had a call with Dan and Omaran, both were pretty short but I gotta set up mock apis for Dan, and we have our bridge stuff tomorrow which I hope will be good, it will be good..Also played sky with nyny!! And I'm enjoying playing sky with her again, also played a little with Sean, but nyny and I went to chill at the memorial place, it's a really chill spot, she also called me her bestie which im doing my very best not to overanalyze 😭, I also found out she's half Canadian!!! How didn't I know about that before??..Didn't get very far in three JS course but went a decent amount in the react course, gonnatry to finish the next module tomorrow but there's a big chance Dr hills gonna stop by to talk about the bridge stuff. ..Also caught up to jjk!! And I was rewatching some Simpson episodes and I laughed a lot, same with vldl content, like my laughter fuse got reset

    Entry: Was debating on going for great, almost caught up fully with jjk manga woo!! Things were getting intense, started today in bum mode again, and didn't get out of it quickly, but essentially started off with jjk, then watched more link click, I've not been paying much attention cause shadow fight and redditt, deleted, didn't resist temptation,..You know what, because of my experience in VR chat I'm giving today a great, before that tho, I tried making chin chin but they were horrible 😭😭😭, didn't get the ingredients in the right proportions, but that's fine, practice makes perfect...Also downloaded hevy, a new training app to try to add more details to my training like RPEs and notes, and I gotta start focusing more on training and less on the rest! They're really getting in my way, which sounds sad, but it's true, seeing the different physiques in jjk, especially toji, is motivating me a ton! And reddit fed me enough body dysmorphia to go on for a few more weeks 😭😭..O speaking of my VR chat experience, I talked to a dude from Egypt who has been to California and New York and Dubai, he sounded like a cool dude and said he was the adventurous type, then we were all surrounding this dude with a suave voice xD, and later I was around this dude who was tripping on weed I assume 😂, and he was experiencing what he was feeling and sometimes, like this time, I wonder what it'd be like feeling those type of experiences, but then the negatives will just outweigh the positives and it's definitely not worth it, ..Anyways back to work life tomorrow, 2 weeks left! It's gonna fly by, I can see it, also friended the Egyptian dude and we were just casually chatting as I was shooting these target thingys, it was pretty chill, . Since I don't want. To be hiding things from you, I still talk to you like you're a real person. XD, but was having a chat with Ben and he was saying how he's in a 1500 deficit, could, not, be, me, but whatever floats his boat, then he showed a website made with J's, and I just looked it up and it is from a tutorial as well, and I don't know if he has built his own software before, but I don't want to call him out on it, doesn't feel like my place, or at least it would mean that I've been snooping around and found out that it wasn't his own code...Just read through our conversation again and I didn't say what I was working on, even though it's nothing fancy, I'm going to start back the three J's course this week, the summer camp program and the riveron project threw me off course, but I'm gonna text Dan about setting up a call tomorrow so he can see the changes and give his guidance..Once the summer is over I'm going to read through what I said I wanted to learn, It was like react, three Js, golang or node, omg I really did just finish the node course recently through working on the reimb project, felt like so long ago ..Also watched some more sex ed which always makes for a fun time, stomach hurts tho, or at least i got some stomach hurt pangs a while back, and hid evidence of the boxers mixup from yesterday 👀👀🤫

    Entry: Sheesh today was definitely a day, and I haven't used discord all day, wait that's a lie, didn't go on the duck all day..mostly! Started out in bum mode, then started looking for sth to eat. Was gonna make chin chin but remembered we had cherries and decided to make a cherry pie, and it turned out great! My mum loved it and the cherry filling was :chef's kiss:, also made the puff pastry myself and even though I didnt follow all the rules like cold water etc stuff like that, It still turned out really well ..Also wore my brothers boxers on accident 😭😭😭, and had to sneakily get rid of the evidence loll, but apart from that, played a lotta of beat saber, Roblox also came go VR and i played some rocitizen, it felt really weird, even though Roblox is still not super immersive. ..Then played sky with nyny and lama then Sean joined later and it was really fun, I did laugh and I didn't feel super anxious about it, im glad that they sought me out because j saw they were online and didn't want to join, oh snap j should do my dailies, but I'm glad they did, we listened to the shell music, talked about wild kids lol, and light bulbs in places light bulbs shouldn't go 😂😭..Then started and almost finished an anime called link click and started reading the jjk manga and I've spent over an hour 30 reading it! I just passed chap 150 and I think I have about 70 ish chapters to get to, which is about what I went through today..Lol changed my mood to great because a lotta good things did happen today, dinner was delishhhh,the warm cherry filling was also delish in the pie, sky, link click being a pretty good anime, and jjk manga being intense, even though fight scenes are hard to follow as usual :*), no worries about seed computer science activity, ..Also did some work on the riveron stuff and I think I'll text Dan tomorrow, was planning on texting him today but I wanted to make an alternative to the special projects page and I'm liking how things look :D, didn't do any work on Minim tho, and I'm fine with that, also trying not to get worked up over GitHub stats and stuff like that and just enjoy the code slash coding process. That's all from me today tho, today went by semi quickly, but all days are linear, ..I do regret not resisting temptation twice, it's a bummer to feel trapped or not in control of myself and I imagine that's how addicts feel, I feel bad for them ..Also I got to bake, I wish I was home alone tho, that's when I like it even more, just turn off my brain and get moving, but whatever, I still enjoyed myself

Idk how possible it'll be but I want to finish the react course before classes start! Like in quarter of the way through so not bad :*), but if I can get to half by the time my internship ends, nowww actually 2 weeks left 🥹, then yeah ..No more 10pm meetings for me, next week is deload week, and yeah off to bed for ms

Or like other social media apps, we were going to give them some examples but then again, they might not have been able to understand and it'd just be weird, so there's that. ..The next one is next week Tuesday, the code was still running in the Dr Hill stuff and I'm gonna be joining in on the calculus professor test tomorrow, hopefully it'll be fun

Sheesh 😭, ..Oh oh new headphonss cams.in today as well and they're sweeet, noise cancellation,.I could hear Omaran much better and errthing, pretty sweet. I have some ideas about how to lengthen my presentation About front end development like asking them about their favorite apps, and then opening it, using visbug to show how the pages are structured, hopefully there's a place where we can present our screen! And showing networks panel for backend etc etc, hmm, yeah , I might not get tdr tomorrow, don't want to feel too tired, the Matlab code is still running:*)..Wowee the weather is cold, nicee, goodnight

    Entry: Trying to form a schedule around doing react work in the morning, then working on work code, sprinkle Futurama stuff here and there, rewatching old episodes now, then working out, then working on oee project, then by 9 work on learning go with Minim, made some good progress and I think it's gonna be steady goings for a while, ..Still trying to learn how to structure the database code but I'm liking the structure of the backend code, looks clean, it feels a bit more structured than node code, sometimes it feels like throwing things at a wall and usually the first thing sticks, but I can only go that far for so long, might even rewrite the reimb site in go 👀..Today's workout made me feel like fainting, like I was tired and heavy squafted and the weights felt heavy, and joints felt weak too, so yeah not the best workout, might not go eat at tdr tomorrow, already halfway through the week and almost at the presentation, which I am not nervous about! ..Gotta ask her for the student emails tomorrow and respond to Julianas email, two of her work mates got fired, so rip ;-;, played Rin a lot with Ethan cahse he didn't have much. To do,..That's all from me tonight tho, woke up pretty refreshed yesterday too ..Also had a call with Dan! Talked over the code and I fixed the transition bug woo!

    Entry: I gotta say I was pretty relaxed, I've been realizing that my schedule is actually pretty great and not too busy compared to others! Especially Omaran, we were able to extend our meeting to 1pm to 4pm cause he had a class by 9, and I saw his calendar once and it was filllled with meetings...and we didn't have our meeting today even though I didn't mind having it, it's gonna be a memory in the past for sure, but I just snuggled up to the new Futurama and old Futurama episodes plus coding Minim in go, which so far has been going smoothly ,so I'm happy about that, didn't structure things Daniels way tho but I'm still interested in knowing how he limited the data access like that . ..Speaking of dan, gonna have a meeting with him tomorrow for more updates on the project Woop Woop, I'm pretty tired, hope i have some cool dreams ..Also finished heavenly delusion, pretty great anime! And watched random animes here and there to find a good one but might just stick with flcl..Today went by quickkk, didn't get the chance to work out but that no longer makes or breaks my day, and we got ice creammmm. I was hoping to be able to play some beat saber but I spent the time on the riveron project so time well spent

    Entry: Today was a day and a half! But also a half day cause time seemed to zoom by so quickly when I wasn't staring at the screen, had a call with the person running the program from China and I suppose it went well, twas a short call tho. Not complaining, right after Mr akinfenwa came and I did NOT recognize him and it was hilarious cause he was on the glass right across from me and was staring at me and it took me a while for my.brain to process 😭😭, ..But we had a chat, and I was lucky.to have hit the nail on the head xD, then Christian showed up,.actually he showed u before and I motivated him to go talk to the speech professor about getting his work done and he did! So it was good. ..Hmm, went to tdr and I wasn't even hungry, but Christian was talking to two girls, one named Niko, then CJ was right next to me and it was so strange, he was telling me about his fictional stories, one about an octopus and one about a meteor releasing some creature , passenger 2, and it was just so bizarre cause I was not at all expecting it, so that happened, seems like we have 3 weeks left tho, but that's 3 work weeks, but I'm sure when it comes around I'd be like the internship wasn't even that long. . I've been hyper focused on the passing of time lately, well hyper focused is a big word, but like, I've been focused on deadlines or when things.will come or when they will go, like I'm looking back to when j first got the news about the Saturday program and that was almost like a week ago and it's just fading in my memory, but yeah I have been looking more.into the future than usual, and then looking into the future imagining my looking into the past, it'll serve me to live in the moment, so might as well try that lol..Also got Andre to join sky beta!

So I was trying to run home before 5 00, and it was 4 30

    Entry: Today was a semi productive semi chill day, chose a random anime, heavenly delusion, and I'm really enjoying it, then there's gene ai, and also hells paradise, all pretty good animes! Then finished the basics of Kyle and used a docker file to launch him, imma start using docker files like that from now on..Also got started on Minim rewrite and I'm already learning a lot, like trying to imagine *variable as meaning expecting a pointer value for that variable , like hello *int expects hello to be a pointer to an integer data type, sth along those lines, and solving cors without looking things up and learning how to use JSON decoder, it's pretty nice to use but I wouldn't say the language is easy, maybe it's relatively easy for others. ...Anyways tho, I asked Ben about the tools hes using to learn ai, it's High time i get started, also did a three Js lesson today, pretty chill work day, back at work tomorrow tho, gonna work more with obstacles, documentation etc

    Entry: End of the day, and like I was saying before, I survived, I always do, and like I was saying before, it still makes me feel like I've regressed somehow :*), ..But moving away from that, ended the day in a productive tone setting up golang with Kyle, then my next.project is to rewrite Minim in golang and fleshen out some other past projects, maybe rewrite them in new languages 👀👀 ...It'll give me a chance to explore new languages and their syntax so I can't complain, I did not do a lot of work on Dan's stuff but tomorrow I'll try to get some work in and ask him if it looks good. I have some components in mind. I was also feeling super unmotivated, especially to start working on the pdf for the summer camp, but I was like, I'm just going to get started and go from there, and I was able to churn out a pretty good PowerPoint, its incomplete cause I'm waiting for Omars part, but the majority of it is there, tomorrow I'll focus on cleaning up the code, making it look bootiful, adding comments, etc etc...I'll also continue on Kyle and I'm essentially pretty close to finishing, I was hoping to get better at shaders but I still need to transfer the three J's lectures from Windows to mint, then i can continue, but I still made decent progress in the time I had , sending messages and replying works ..Also my first Uber driver said I was jacked loll, add to the complement list 😭😭, the NH hypertrophy program is actually insane ..I played a teensy bit of beat saber , got paid a hundy, and that's about it tbh, tomorrow might not be a bum day, I'll work on launching Kyle, and yeah I'm enjoying go, hope to use it more, for my rewrite in Minim, im doing everything raw, from scratch, using part of Anthony ggs setup cause I like it..Also finished mushoku tennsei, don't think I said I was watching it here..Edit ..Shae was there as wel!!!

    Entry: I don't wanna worry but I'm still worrying, about tomorrow, transportation, the event itself, maybe not even as much of the event itself, mostly.being worried about transportation 😭, which is kinda weird, but also being semi angry about losing 4 hours of my weekend, which is kinda stoopid, but like, still , at times like these I feel like I made no progress in all the years that I've felt overwhelmed or nervous about something, and that is a bummer. ..In better more positive news, Linux mint might be my go to from now on , got some progress on Dr Hill work too, ..But yeah it always feels like a bummer when I feel stressed about something and try to remember all my years of doing stuff like this to no avail, bht I guess at the end of the day, the common ground is that, I survived all of them and I'll get through this one too, not as bad as the sat tests 😭😭😭,..Like I survived this week, Also finished meeting with Dr bani Taan and with Omaran just now, and Dr bani Taan said he was working on a grant to get two students to help with some tech thingy and he was like both of us would be the first people he will contact if he gets the grant 🥹🥹, which is pretty great and it makes me slightly happy that I took this opportunity, so even if the grant doesn't work out, at least we've cemented ourselves in his mind

That'll take away like 3 semesters worth of balance, which is amazing, more than amazing, and I do feel pretty happy, but it's like there are two parts of me fighting for happy or overcast ;-;

Worked out alone mostly, Donovan was there but we worked out separately, reminded me of when I could work out and just focus on myself, felt nice and I felt super pumped, the pump after was insaneee..Sky's brining a bunch a news, days of fashion! And mum made zobo, and they're trying to beat a world record - sky is, and PC beta is out, and aurora stuff Is coming back woo!! I'm so full, also just found out that work ends Aug 11, and I feel meh cause, didn't resist, and Richard messaged my brother to message me about this thingy they're doing on Saturday and I wanna say no cause I don't wanna do it but I also wanna meet Richard again, but then j just got my Saturdays to myself but then again I know I'm just going to bum and roll around without Aim for the first few hours so this will give me something to do and if my brothers going as well I'll be able to follow him in the drive and not have to use Uber which does comfort me a bit .Rn im feeling super tired..Christian wasn't here again and I was almost able to get Way with lunch alone, almost, Donovan showed up :*(, Anyways I showed him my java class code and it was pretty fun to take a trip down memory lane

Didn't do a ton of coding today and work was just boringgggg, felt so much like sleeping, like, was gonna take a nap and sniffing marker level of boredom xD...Did some vids of the react course, and going into the rain waters vid of the three J's course which I am exciteddd about, we get to learn animation and stuff..Pretty tired tho, so gonna cut short and ask Dr Hill to see if I can do sth else tomorrow

    Entry: Knowing so many people is exhausting :*), or it must be cause I don't even know that many and I'm not a fan of running into people I know, sometimes it's fun, other times blech, this time it was okay, I ran into that dude that said I was buff the other day and we got into like a 20 min conversation and he knew about fufu and he was telling me about his past and stuff like that, then he asked for my age, then I was like I'm also a junior, then yeah. I'm sure I threw the awkward smile a few times, more than a few times, maybe it's the awkward smiles part that I don't like more than the actual meeting of people, it would all be easier in a VR world ..Also Dr Hill responded to Juliana himself and I have a meet at 4 with Dr bani Taan and also sent the msg to Dan about working on software so we are gonna meet at 6 30 tomorrow then on Thursday we have the meeting with Juliana. ..I didn't eat anything for breakfast and hoping that I brought enough money for tdr and enough willpower :*),at least hopefully it'll all change once normal classes get started l... Hopefully...Edit ..And now it's like my brains in a fog and everything I'm thinking of is just foggy, the feeling will pass for sure so I guess.ill just feel it

    Entry: My attention span is getting way too short, wayy too short, and I need excess stimulation to feel at baseline, aka random YouTube videos playing or playing shadow fight at slight boredom, anything to keep boredom away, so I deleted shadow fight, side note sky's new season starts tomorrow eee, but deleted that and most games! Especially since I downloaded like 3 new games in the morning, and got angry cause there was no ice cream and I really wanted early morning ice cream ..Then my huevos are hurting, well just one, and I feel like I'm going back down the tetanus circle, or maybe this circle that I went on a year? A few months? Ago, I don't even know at this point, and it has caused me to overthink and slightly overthink about tempering my overthinking, I think I'm doing a 6/10 job at it, better than the tetanus situation loll, ..But just so I don't get too carried away, got a few good moments today, continued working on Kyle and made some decent progress and I'd like to say deleting shadow fight and stuff like that helped cause I found myself reaching for my phone then I was like nah, imma just keep watching sex education, ugh top notch show and work on kahll, the season finale was absolutely hilarious!!! I have the humor of a child xD ..Apart from that tho, back to la situación del huevo, what am I going to do? Ignoring it feels unrealistic,.and I have to fight the constant temptation to feel it and try to gather some sort of extra information that I don't already know? Side note again I watched Shang chi of the seven rings and fitness server has been dead lately, oh well. ..Ignoring it for sure wouldn't work, but paying too much attention to it also wouldn't serve me, so what am I gonna do? Deep breaths, and coexist with it till it goes away, if it turns to be something big, which I'm sure it's not and before I go down the path of "it's rare" and then I think "but I may be one of the rare cases", same process with dying of tetanus 😭, I'm just gonna put my hands off it and let myself heal, no tdr tomorrow , idk if I'll be able to put up with seed gen 2, well, with the Christian Donovan combo specifically. ..Anyways, watched about half an hour of three J's course but took a step back cause I wanna come back at it fresh, hopefully no more hours spent playing shadow fight , sky's new season tomorrow thooo, season pass mayhaps 🥹🥹🥹..That's all from me tho, I think I'll also turn off YouTube notifications

    Entry: Choosing happyish cause today ZOOOMED by , and had a fair share of ice cream, now for the main point of today's entry, I was looking back on the memories section and saw the first image I'm putting, and funnily enough im seeing react in a similar light now, like I'm making progress, understanding stuff better, but I was still like, not necessarily overthinking, but there are times when I feel like a complete frustrated noob again, side note, thinking in the react way kinda makes me feel like I'm using a different part of my brain ..But I do feel very noob like asking noob questions with noob solutions, and I guess honestly thats the only way I'll learn, and even though it feels terrible, and like I'm better/above feeling like that, the truth is that I ain't above feeling nothing :*), side note i really want to do an anime expo and do an ekko cosplay 🥹🥹, there's one going on in November!!..The entry in the picture also reminds me that things can change at any time, I don't want to get all mopey tho, I absolutely love the show sex education, it makes me feel for the actors really, it's weird, I'm kinda looking forward to school starting back up, ..Did some more work with shaders today, trying to solidify fragment and vertex shaders so gonna do the three Js course mañana

    Entry: Wore shorts today and it was horrrrible, also wore the chest day shirt and I felt super uncomfortable and still suck in my stomach after eating uGh, don't worry I'll get over it and intently stop myself till I reach a better point. Learned about shaders and they're cool to work with! And fun to learn about, I wanna make a tech futuristic chat bot type site with a shader that changes size and tone based on sentiment and so on, it'll be cool! Learned about fragment shaders which manage essentially the color of the fragments and the vertex shaders manage the vertex points in the 3d or technically 4d space, along with how uniforms are shared between the two and attributes come from the geometry which we can set ourselves, also learning about react form handling, didng get to the controlled form events handling part but this is just essentially a recap for me xD, future me you can ignore this..Also spent some time speeding up the algorithm, Juliana hasn't responded, yas, but I still got the time down to a decent place. ..It was so nice to eat lunch in peace 🥹🥹. Weekend best end, gonna finish the form handling lesson in react tomorrow, dangjt haven't texted Daniel still ;-;, apart from all that tho, pretty, okay , I guess day...Had some strawberry icecream, also had a weird dream where I was in vicsum, and something about food, like a burrito, don't remember all of it :*)

    Entry: Today was a pretty meh day, not in a bad way, just In a meh way, like woke up feeling pretty refreshed tbh, went to skewl and was hungry, then went to a hectic lunch where this 14 year old that looked 18 said my forearms were big, I was wearing my so over it oversized T-shirt to not bring attention to myself :*). Then this other dude called me big.guy and said some other things as i was getting dessert but i didn't hear anything other than the big guy comment 😂😂,..Then I just realized more and more that I don't jive with seed gen 2, well that may be an overgeneralization, but the two combo you know and I know, they're hard to keep up with, at least they're going on a field trip tomorrow. And I'll be work sweet work 🥹, I'll be able to have tdr to myself, having the money for that is another question 😭🥹, ..Apart from that tho, might be setting up a meeting with Juliana soon, and I'm continuing the react course, and I'm enjoying it! Like I'm learning stuff about how changing state rerenders the component which is how react updates things - but still keeps track of the data, but there was a challenge that stumped me and it was because I was tryinf to use the use state to keep two pieces of data in sync, when one depended on the other, so I should've relied on the rerendering nature of react, like the reactive nature of Vue, to update the data without the need for use state, I do wonder if I would need refs, wow just went down a rabbit hole of trying to map out how Vues reactivity works compared to reacts, but it doesn't matter now , I'm learning,..The course that I'm finding it hard to continue on tho is the three J's course 😭😭, it is getting longer and much much more complicated , we are talking about shaders now and it's hard for me to see a use for it right now, like three J's is more of a side thing to enhance my web dev, but it does still have valuable skills that I can take away, so I am going to stick with it till the end!! Might be a bit slow, but I shall persevere 🥹..Then pull day was not terrible but cut short cause I was playing 2k19 in Donovan's dorm, almost forgot to mention, and then this girl walked in and couldn't keep eye contact with her and I think she was Donovan's sister? Twins? Idek tbh, but it was just weird,..Just looked in the mirror and started criticizing how I looked, like face discoloration? Different coloration? Then just felt stupid for the essentially vain behavior, but I still wanna get a haircut, that usually makes me feel confident and somehow more jacked..I was able to enjoy some how to Spanish podcasts, the harem still goes on..Also had a call with Omaran and we got to a really good place on the site, gonna present to Dr bani

Don't mind it at all, so just gonna continue doing my thing tomorrow and hope for the best, didn't do a lot of side programing, none really, didn't have the call with Omaran which is good enough ,I really wanna, oop I lied, continued the three J's course and we are learning how to organize the code structure and it's getting pretty complicated but what can I do, I prolly won't be structuring small projwcts like that, just medium to big sized projects ..I really want to respect my free.time.but there are some things I wanna learn that I haven't gotten around to like three.js. but yeah I really wanna edit the UI of the site to make it look nicer, gonna do that tomorrow , watched some Simpsons episode and I was feeling too uptight but I had to loosen up, judt.let myself go xD ..Worked out with my harem today tho, it was pretty good but exhaustingggg, barbwll rows are surprisingly exhausting yeah. Tomorrow's leg day tho, so let's go? ..Also no more sleeping on my back cause it makes my neck hurt :*). Also gonna get me some tdr food tomorrow, the plan? Okay so work on Dr Hill stuff at work, as expected, work out and crush it, then work on styling the site for Omaran, then react and three J's course? The current lesson is like 3 hours long lol, but yeah, could do some react lessons, I be slacking yo

    Entry: Today was a very very very lazy day and even though I kept telling myself to chillax and take a day to rest my.brain , I feel like.being productive does a lot more to keep me feeling satisfied, then have a good chill session, than just a lazy day, but still binge watched the entire first season of sex education, amazing hilarious show xD, makes me miss highschool, then i remember hs is nothing like that and I never/rarely got involved in other people's drama, so there's that xD..Mum.made chin chin,.delish. like I mentioned before, I've been feeling really happy with my physique lately, I'm not jazzed to be starting the new work week tbh, and bleych and all that bluch, blech, I'll push through, try to get as much work as possible done tomorrow, see if the generated fsm files for the 2t 6r 4t will work, hopefully they do, then tweak the fsm interpreter to store the files in the proper folder so it doesnt just get stored with the weird || format, apart from that, yeah test 426 and work on folder renaming, there's not really a pressing side project for me to be working on now, tweaking the reimbursement site to be a bit better would be nice I suppose, gotta send Dr mina a message about that! I hope Andre got the email looking good, I think he did? Blech, I was just gonna talk about working along for senior design project, but still blech too early to be thinking about that mostly ..I was just getting random stomach pain pangs, and they hurt. Tomorrow I'm starting back my routine as normal and trying not to let working out with others mess it up too much 😭, my very.own workout harem loll..Apart from all that though, did like absolutely 0 coding today, I'm still bummed about not being able to think of stuff to make that others will use, makes me feel dumb, I guess it's like.people who wanna say they wanna make a difference in the world but don't go out of their way to do so? And just like the idea of being someone that makes a difference without thinking about the baggage that comes with it, like lately I've been imagining what being famous would look like more than normal, like suddenly blowing up and having others recognize you, I'm not even an adult yet, which is not a valid point, but like, even in that case! Watching sex education makes me feel/remember that there are so many things and experiences that I'm missing out on, probably for the best, even playing sky does that sometimes, but I.just have to be grateful to God for my health, like, I still have the opportunity to experience said things, and maybe, most likely my focus right now is on things of the land, things of the earth, iffy non permanent things,.there's a but incoming but I don't know how to justify it really, so there's that..I am fortunate to have a lot of the things that I have now, muy muy fortunate, and to have the experiences that I have now, cough cough the ropes course lol, Ojalá que tenga el tiempo suficiente para experimentar todas las cosas que quiero experimentar en mi vida y espero que me sienta satisfecho cuando esté viejo...So yeah that's where I am right now, cool entry, also I'm glad I recorded the dream I had earlier, might start seeing more dream journals here 👀..And some day I'll come to cherish the lazy days where I just play shadow fight, watch shows and eat and not have anything pressing on my mind except how lazy I am, so why not enjoy them, thinking of changing my mood away from meh cause some soundtracks from S.E gave me some nice memories, but it's how it started, and I'm still feeling down about not being able to make sth popular, but I shan't rush it, take things one step at a time and I'll find my way..Lol opened YouTube after this and saw a Kevin Powell vid about  css tips, then thought that there should be a site with all of them in one place, might make sth like that

Or at least trapped in this van, then I escaped into another car with a dude that tried to help us, its all pretty blurry now, but the soccer one was super fun cause is scored twice.lol

    Entry: Finished IEYTD and played VR chat with Ben, two highlights of my day honestly, im planning on playing more VR chat tomorrow, made a semi connection with two dudes, playing chess with one dude and met another dude who owned a bunch a custom chess boards and has been playing for like 20 years, even competitively, it's insane, it gives me semi the same feelings that being on minutiae gives me. They were even drawing homer when i walked in xD, it was great, I'll check that world again tomorrow. ..Apart from that, watched the sao progressive movie which was pretty nice, finished day 7, kinda :(, and day 8, kinda 😭 of AOC, had the first part right but had to use someone else's code and try to understand what they're doing ..Oh another highlight, earlier today hopped on a call with mantas and helped him debug some code! He said he'll pay me a hundy but I said hes fine, unless I'm nitro desperate loll, but I'm happy that the work was working for him, after I helped fix it, I got a big imposter semi syndrome that it doesn't actually work or that it's bad code, then I just told myself to shut up 😭, ..The random first image is from the Google maps coordinate in I expect you to die 2s ending, but dood that ending was amazinggggggg, like, didn't even expect it 😭..It also rained and twas nice, I'd like to add destress to the emotions of today, the time did seem to fly by, and watched a bunch a south park, so I guess destress is right, most of the things I did today were nice to dos but not necessary, like fixed some parts of my portfolio and got it deployed in the domain, helped mantas, did AOC, I got bummed cause I really want to make sth that many people will use and build a following that way, but that might be unrealistic,😭, then ate, did some more coding, watched some sao, talked to Ben and Andre about senior projects and got defensive about ai taking front end jobs :/, it is kinda dumb to get defensive over it, but whateved happens ,I'll adapt..Ben's still playing with this girl and he was saying how he was making her laugh and for some reason, idk, I felt left out? 😭 Not that, but not not that, idk, whateverrrr imma go slep noa

    Entry: Ok I was leaning more towards happy ish but this feels more appropriate, I asked Dr Hill if I could follow them and he said yes! And I had fun! And I had to sign a waiver saying they wouldn't be held liable in case of death, so yeah 😭😂, but it was super fun, semi scary, I tried a double diamond one, Christian finished but I, heck nooo, that was tough 😭, the first one I knew I couldn't do it then the other ones were a bit easier but still toughhh, made.some.more connections with the seed students tho ..Anyways got back to campus and Christian quizzed me.in Spanish lol, then optimized my portfolio, changed the domain, and went bum mode, tomorrow I'll use.open graph protocol to get a popup of the site but for now I'm liking it, it's still a bit clanky on mobile.tho. went to eat at this mediterranean place and there was so much food, mostly eh food tbh, tried this grape.leaves wrap thing and it must was.blech, they had lentils which were okay, I'd say I still prefer.mg.lentils.ive had better burritos but who am I to complain it was free and I like free! ..After all that, went bum mode on some anime.orogramming memes subreddit and the memes were just amazing 😭😭, then did a call with Omaran ,badabing bada boom, here I am, TGIF and gonna text Dan, eventually 😭

    Entry: Another great day OOOOO, what are the chances lol, rn mostlu.i just feel like.notbing is weighing me down, did a check-in with Dr Hill so I have stuff to do, tomorrow.ill see if I can ask him about joining the ropes course with the seed students, had lunch with Emmett and Christian and honestly it was pretty fun, I couldn't eat as much as I wanted but that feels like more of a pro than a con, also new sky wallpapers!! Gonna change the one on my computer once I'm home, also gonna text Dan about the design stuff, AOC day 7, gonna try to tackle it again 😭, now it's weighing me down a lil bit but it's all for fun, not gonna take it too seriously, gonna learn about making trees in go and brush up on the ds! So it's a win win, also gonna practice more go, shared my basic portfolio with the duck and pise and pise thought it was good so I'm not gonna overthink it, I'm pretty happy with it! ..Gonna work more on it once I'm home, even more reason to be great! Mum's staying at work today woo! And I don't think I'll have the call with Omaran but even if I do, I don't mind it at all! I think I'll even work on the UI to make things look a lot nicer! ..And gotta work on some ACSO flyers, that's fine. And I met someone named Donovan and played a teensy bit of basketball, Christian invited him to workout with us so now I have a workout harem of 3.peopl 😂, we also played some riddles with chat.gpt being in love with mining riddles of something in a wooden box for some reason..Pretty good day if I do say so maself

    Entry: So I smell another great day 👀👀, usually I'd be feeling super elated to use like rad or great but these past two days are mostly small wins, happy moments, except when vercel decides to act dumb eeee! But imma deal with that tomorrow, basic portfolio version out, not responsive and no animations, just to test multiple screen sizes ..Anyways tho! First things first, woke up feeling groggy, but had a nice dream, good shower went to skewl and started diligently with some work, lol, ..Got a small decent amount of work done, cleaned the code, preallocated resources, the whole Shabang. Then worked more on me portfolio, made some good progress, there are some parts I don't love but all in all it's coming together splendidly. I do debate whether I like my last portfolio better but it's definitely more readable, provides more interactions and shows more about me, and uses three Js. it's a win win..Tried day 7 of AOC but Mann it's hard, tomorrow I'm gonna dive into implementing it, wish me luck 😭, not gonna give up! Breh just went down a mini rabbit hole of looking up the popularity of golang compared to other languages etc etc, looks like it's steadily climbing and is pretty sought after but no very widely. I'll look up uses of go after ..Anyways worked out with Andres and it was pretty nice! Didn't pr on bench but wuteva, off go bed,

    Entry: Should add a dream log emotion, but I had a dream where there were these bad people trying to take Ethan away I think, so we told him to hide and confronted them., Then it turned out they were nice and wanted a game of some football type thing against me because one of my skills , the desire to score a goal or sth like that was super high compared to theirs, so we were playing and i was winning by insane.moves, then they left and I went back to Ethan who was ina. Computer science type room, then after leaving, I realized I had lost my.phome and keys? and tried to look for it but couldn't find it in time

Season 10 is better than I gave it credit for with great animation. ..Zoro to had an update and ad blockers don't work anymore, sadness...There are some ar glasses going on to the market so maybe I'll be able to make a YUI with enough funding 👀🥺, ..Played some more sky today, and uhh oh IEYTD has a mission that's actually amazing, it reveals that we have been caught 😂..I already got so used to staying home from 4 days of home stay and now i have to reaccustom myself to working life 😭

Got to work on my portfolio, which I'm not absolutely loving, but I do think it's better and more usable than my previous one. My previous one even looks trash in comparison now 😭..Had a call with Omaran and he was telling me about optimization stuff and.open source.projects to contribute to, even sent me a link and errthing. Day 5 of AOC was toughhh, longest.ive taken on one but it was so satisfying when it worked 🥹🥹🥹🥹, gonna start day 6 early tomorrow, finish the blender tutorials! Maybe get restarted on react course, continue my portfolio, etc etc. ..Hmm what else, now I'm winning in the chess game with Rami, ez clap lol, nothing much more to say, sky days of music started! Gonna try to get the sax or at least the hat ..Tomorrow's another holiday woo!

    Entry: Today's like on the verge of being a great day, this has felt.like a pretty long weekend honestly, woke up at like 9, and had some good dreams but forgot them :(, then went mini bum mode, finished Aoc day 5 >:), played some more IEYTD 2,, pretty fun, then started fully designing my new portfolio and I'm lovvvvingggg how it's looking, just have to get the skills section down and it'd look chefs kiss, also the colored version of the site...Then played payday with Ethan and Ben, till Ben and I got into an argument on anime vs cartoon, I won of course B), but at.least it had me flexing a brain muscle left dormant after a while, started oshi no ko again and it's still as good as I remember. Tomorrow's another work day, but day off Tuesday woo! Most likely going to have a meeting with Dr Hill tomorrow to catch him up on stuff, so I'm gonna show him the data, the averages, I don't think he knows specifically the data but Im sure I'm looking at opt time and I'll just let him know I've been working on preallocating resources. Might be having a meeting with Dr mina soon, And then all the stuff with Omaran even sooner. Tomorrow I guess, ain't gonna worry about it cause thas dumb..Also rained quite a bit today, didn't enjoy it much tho. That's about all I did today tbh, played shadow fight, watched some archer, I'm not enjoying the later seasons, but it has its charms, not gonna be able to work out tomorrow :(, but I'm looking forward to tdr food. Did more work on the donut blender tutorial as well..Ok so I'm reading entries from like 2 years ago and I feel like I was a more thoughtful person back then xD, also found some comedy gems, but I could talk about something that kind of bothers me, like in the server today I had mentioned me redesigning my portfolio to make it look better, and even when I asked for feedback on the grid vs list view, I fidn't get any response really, which bummed.me.out because if felt like they were either ignoring me or couldn't feel how happy I felt, then I suppose that that's the same way I feel when Ben's showing his projects or stuff.like that and I ignore it or gloss over it or Andre and his book stuff , I suppose if they put a lot into somethingand share it wjth their friends but dont get the enthusiasm they were expecting, it makes it harder for them to pretend like what others are dojng matters much to them, like for me, i like it when the suny side server appreciates my projects or celebrates my victories with me, give me feedback etc etc and im really hyoed about redesigning my portfolio, and omg auto complete is acting super slow but i imagine if ben was squealing n excitedness about some project he was working on and i wss just like cool, I would be kinda sad i didnt have anyone really to share in my excitedness, and honestlh right now i cant say as a fact that i dont like tbe feeling of someone desiring something that j have if that makes sense. Like, I don't want to say it gives me a feeling of power, but then I'd just be lying, there we go auto complete is acting normal again, and autocorrect, maybe I just got hacked, o well, in any case, ..Moral of the day, I like it when j have people to share my wins with me, and j imagine others also like it when their friends celebrate their wins, so I should work towards being able to openly be happy for someone, meh not really sequitur, but that fulfills my deep quota lol

Hmm what else, didn't talk much on the discord today, just didn't feel like it, and went super bum mode a lot 😭. Also didn't eat a lot, felt hungry but the heat didny really make me go out of my way to find sth to eat.lol, I'm not missing the gym as much, I might be slacking off, once the pga golf thingy is back, I'm coming back with full force. ..Also did some more of the blender tutorial, might be able to finish it tomorrow! I've been enjoying go and the problem solving of Aoc. Also finished mashle, really funny anime, and started neon Genesis, which was meh,..Nothing else to add tho, for sure gonna play more IEYTD tomorrow ..Had a really fun dream too! It was like a treasure hunt type thing, but I was in like a red matter 2 type world trying to solve puzzles, also I'm really considering making like a real life SAO, not literal.sao  XD, but like a real virtual world

Tomorrow, we go for day 3 >:),...The most fun part of today tho was the scavenger hunt! It was super fun and I'm finally working on code again after suffering with all the tests and debugging, right now just looking at things like preallocating resources but they're mostly smaller changes since the data isn't super big, well, the more I do it the more I'll come across plays to better the code ..Didn't even eat much today too! And I've been getting so many flipping compliments on being big, mostly because I'm out finally meeting new people. Andreh was there as well and he was like I'm flipping jacked and everytime he sees me, I get more jacked, I suppose hypertrophy training is working 😭😭, no gym for a few days tho, but I'm not loving the attention so I feel like stepping back? I'd very much prefer to be this jacked than be skinny or fat, so yeah, working out ftw...Met the other seed students tho, and they're pretty cool too, umm, the scavenger hunt was super fun, the weather was hotttt tho, and I sweat a lot, cause aaaaa that's why, so yeah..Dr Hill didn't come with us but Dr lynch did, and I think I unawkwarded our relationship! Which is great, I'm trying not to see him through other people's lens, and he was like he started working out and stuffi like that...Listening to Roy shakked now and his music always brings back memories ..All in all, today was a pretty good day, but ended up very rut like, im really hoping to be able to work on a project to bring like yui to reality in like a VR slash ar world, finished Sao too!

The site is getting way too overwhelming so I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow about reducing the complexity or going with a completely different idea, and I think he'll agree. ..Apart from that, field trip tomorrow that I'm totally not nervous about :*), also cause gotta head to campus early tomorrow. Made some good progress on blender tho..I haven't worked out for the past 2 days and I'm half bummed, well only a slight bit bummed because idk other people's comments are getting to me, even Christian was like why don't I play football, and I don't think my frame is any big, not gonna worry about it too much, so gotta go early to skewl tomorrow..Also 100 percent gonna finish Sao tomorrow..Didn't eat from tdr today too, the field trip shouldn't take the entire day, I think? If we leave at 9 - we are either going scavenger hunting or to the museum cause of air quality, next week they're going rock climbing 😭😭, I wish I could join, but oh wel.Oh oh also started the Advent of code all in go and learned how to read from a file and do stuff with some other stuff

There was one cute girl that was part of them, and ugh I feel dumb 😂, but she was! But the other dudes are cool, I played chess with Andre and he won the first 2 games so I won the next 10 games, tdr food was really good. ..Hmm then what else, the air quality was super bad today!! I took a measurement of all my body parts today for future reference, I was saying to myself that it.migjt do me well to get a smaller physique and focus on cardio, maybe? I still enjoy lifting weights, it'd a different ballpark, but my heart's still a big player in my health so I gotta get it up to speed ..I'll think about it, just a bit scared of losing the gains, which I enjoy, but still body dysmorphia is a bum and I'm obviously not gonna let it win!

But yeah! Gonna work on the site tomorrow.tho, for sure, did a bit of work on the reimb project, nothing major, so I don't have a lot to do, I'm still debating whether to use gin with go, and at this point I'm just gonna give up on default go and learn through gin, ..

    Entry: Okay today's a pretty great day so far, it's raining, or semi raining, my colds gone, knock on wood, I'm about to finish part one of the three J's course and made a grilled cheese in blender, and making a model of sth i thought would take me years to do - the flight helmet - with three J's, didn't do a lot of actual work in research but it's fine, i don't think Dr Hill is here yet. And now for the highlight, as i was walking out of tdr, this dude said i was jacked with like the lifting weights emote : insert xank emoji lol: then we talked, he's part of the summer bridge and asked if he could work out with me, so yeah, also played chess with Rami, won one, then lost in a disgraceful way 😭😭, but it was still a good and respectable.game. ..Then worked out with Christian, he pushed me on some.exercjses like chinups, made me go past my limits and work harder, even pushed me to put weight on calf raises, and i spotted him on chin ups, something I'd never done with someone before, there are two sides of me fighting, one site is anxious that i wouldn't have the fitness center to myself again and another side is excited cause I'd have someone to push me in the gym and i can push him as well! We'd be gym brosss...But yeah i told him i couldn't drive cause i was 17 loll, i may have come on too strong 😭, shouldve waited it out, but yeah he thought i was 20, also pred on squats, relatively, 255 for 9 and they were good reps too! I should've asked him if he watches anime!..Now I'm thirsty and semi hungry, nahhh tdr had some divine garlic bread 🥹🥹, full belly, happy heart, slight dysmorphia getting out of control that needs to be put in control. Apart from all that, yay : ✨, I'm really.hoping i didn't mishear Omaran when he said that we'll meet next week, i really really hope so! If not, whatever, I'm gonna try to finish the three Js lesson woo!

Also started the to-do list stuff in go, and wow go is a weird language, and got the hardest tasks for the reimb project done, gonna leave the remaining feature up to the rest. ..Uhh what else what else, tomorrow chest day, going for 225 for 10!! I don't got much to say tho, finished archer season...Also i put impending stress cause I'm still not happy about having to have calls with Omaran, but i suppose my life just moves from chapter to chapter, from kapor center calls to SCP meetings to coding club meetings etc etc , and I'd be honestly bored without these, soooo i think I'd be better off with them than without them...I don't have anything insightful to share tonight tho, just feeling tired, tomorrow's another work week

    Entry: Pretty good day, played payday 2 with Ethan and Andre while Ben watched, and it was fun, but i had to leave, then started the blender portion of the three J's course wooo, I'm still kicking myself to think of a good go project, honestly a simple to-do list.will do me good, I'm doing a rubber ducking project tho,just to get the basics of go down, even though a to-do app would suit much better 😭😭, but yeah, also did some work along on the challenge app and made some trash progress which I'm okay with, i preferred it a lot more over a call with omaran. ..Hmm, what else, added a profile page feature for mobile to reimbursement with some.otner small tasks, just gotta finish the mileage and validation section and we'll be smooth sailing bayby, tomorrow's Sunday, phew i almost thought it was Monday, i can get it done by then. Same with account page validation, I'm now fresh...I've also had a bad neck ache ;-; but it comes and goes, so it's weird..Might as well add this part, was first having a conversation with Ben about eigenvectors, then it moved to a conversation about learning and learning speed, then somehow it moved to a conversation about how we see each other, and he said caring efficient and happy, caring, I'd hardly consider myself a truly caring person, when i can't feel truly happy for them, efficient ,ehh maybe lol, happy, happiness is, id rather be fulfilled , happy with the outcome of something, but fulfilled with the outcome of life, just dropping quote bombs B(, but yeah there are still things I need to work on, and i suppose I'm my own greatest critic!! 😭😭..So yeah life's hard, and beating myself up only makes it harder, apart from that tho, the plan for tomorrow - start, maybe not finish but at least continue the blender lesson, do a to-do list application in go to first wet your breaks, round out the reimbursement site, add better messaging etc etc, and yeah have fun

Saturdays recovered 😭, tears of joy, but I'm still gonna message Daniel eventually, I'm using react and go to create a rubber ducking project, using gpt of course...What else what else, no workout, not much progress on site, feeling slightly ticked off with not being able to keep up with the random challenge app code, it's just structured in a way I'm not used to, i guess i have to be more flexible. There's a new feature where i can touch the screens in VR and it'll interact with the objects, super nice!..Today was a largely blah day with a good ending, also had a delicious dinner, yay :)

But yeah the console stuff isn't working so I might have to go back to my previous way of doing things , actually i might try one last thing tomorrow, wish me luck. ..Anyways, yeah i also felt soooo tired, like to the point of almost falling asleep after a good tdr meal, which got interrupted by the onset of orientationers😭. Then i spent the day dreading my meeting with omaran but it turned out nice, we've started coding, so yay, but it's hard to understand what he's saying and I'm sure it's hard for him to understand what I'm saying as well :*)..He's also a master's student, i was able to speak my mind about others not doing tasks and got Andre to do the logo task, yay, lol, and I hmm my legs are SOREEE, insanely sore, like they got more sore throughout the day 😭, leg day ftw, today wasn't the best upper day tho, :(, but tomorrow Friday best day ..What else what else, i started the audio book of five rings by miyato musashi, so yeah j. General, today started off eh, then at work was very eh, but i got far in Sao, pretty good season 2, then workout was eh, i know I'm taking so much stuff for granted rn :*) and prolly overtime i just start sounding more and more like a spoiled brat, but even as i say, just cause, in this case, my past problems were worse than my current problems doesn't make my current problems less bad. But I'm happy most of my problems aren't actually problems, a bad workout? Not even objectively bad, an unproductive day? I set up neovim and I'm finding it hard imagining myself using it but we'll see, it's gotta be loved for a reason, i finished the physics lesson in the three J's course! Now we are gonna be importing models baybayyyy, pretty cool eh, I'm gonna import my own models alongside him, it's gonna be sweet. ..Still doing the react course, and I'm hoping on doing it with react, dood i really don't bave the drive to learn react xD, but i can push through, i know i can, for the greater good. Then uhhh, that's prolly about it for me, didnt resist :(, and TGIAF, that's all from me tho, don't have a lot more to say

    My mood Lazy
    
    Entry: Very very much lazy day, made slight progress in the fsm project but buttt i was able to get the pdf stuff working thank God, all that's left is to tackle the mileage and try to get the others working on their features :*) ..Also finished baby driver, great movie, and Sao, pretty good ending, both of them were veeeeeeery satisfying!!..Hmm what else, didn't resist ;(, and had a great leg workout, got pumped up and now I'm full of food and water and feel like id throw up if i lie on my belly lol, goodnight tho, today was a very lazy day, also bailed on call with omaran, cause, yeah

    Entry: Just got off a call with omaran and didn't eat dinner , 😭, i think i saw him today as well in person, but that's fine cause i ate a lotta calories today from tdr :*). Anyways, Ben was telling me about his plan to do a ton of schooling and it reminded me of the time when i was planning where i would live in the future xD, everything felt like it was stable and set in stone and now that's not the case anymore, for the most part at least,  i know i like developing stuff but idk if i can say it is what I'd feel fulfilled doing, i mean I'm feeling pretty happy about what I'm working on now to be honest, the video go video ASCII project, and it's going pretty well so far, using things like chalk, FS extra, etc etc. ..And i enjoy it a lot more than the Dr Hill stuff 😭, speaking of which he's not gonna be here tomorrow, woo!! But we'd prolly need to get onna call tomorrow, I'll also text omaran about moving the meeting earlier, o i also decided to get some work done on the reimbursement project, specifically on the pdf stuff and i made some good progress too...O and during my workout, Margo was there and deadlifted 315s for reps 😭😭, me and me weak self 😭. But nah i find it hard to really connect with my back on rowing movements, at least not my.lower back 😭, got an extra rep in bench press and i think I'll switch incline dumbbell for incline barbell, i prefer barbells for this one. ...Hmm what else, i guess going back to the discussion about a solid goal, i dont really have any for the time being, my focus is on gaining as much knowledge as possible and seeing where it all takes me, and i suppose i don't mind it, my goal right now is to learn a ton of new tech and broaden my horizons, when i turn 18 I'll do one of my yearly recaps, but I've learned a ton about backend technologies and can relate more to the sunny server now, i gotta ping Adrian and ask how he's being. I'm learning three Js, honestly i can't really differentiate when.i started what, like when i got into Vues composition api, or vite, or nuxt, also i finished an entire node course wooo Woop, but uh,yeah, i wonder how necessary a long term plan is, usually something throws it all out of whack, like past me said,..O also i killed the giant fly in the office xD, but i wonder if i look up Arlington, I'll be able to find my plans, or maybe from the wildlife server, omg bio buddies, definitely from the wildlife server 🥹🥹, those were not simpler times loll ..I mean i should contact Dan about the modeling stuff , when things slow down tho, for now, i can stick to what I'm doing, which is ..- wake up, thank God .- head to work .- do stuff for an extended period of time without making much progress because eeeeee, maybe I'd have been better off without an internship, probably not, cause then I'd just be bored all day, and i get bored already and I don't like the feeling, actually tomorrow I'll try to see if i can make some more.progress on the ASCII project, lol im looking at the project with the desire to work on it rather than the reimbursement project which is more like i have to work on it, i can't wait to test the image overlay feature tomorrow, hopefully it works! .- lunch.- workout .- home .- chill, three.js course, react course, reimbursement project .- eat.- sleep and repeat ..I should read my entry from the beginning of the summer about all the things I'm gonna be learningxD, ..That's all for this entry tho, Duolingo has gotten super repetitive but i know I get spurts of motivation and demotivation so I'm still chugging along, also yesterday was Ethan's bday and 2 days ago was Ms Yates bda.Also i drank a ton of water today, gimme the pointsss

    Entry: Just got off a call with omaran, also, no work today!!!! National holiday ftw, still went to school but it was closed, and saw Margo along the way, didn't do a full workout, but a nice beat saber workout,continued working on my image to ASCII code site and i mean, it turned out pretty good,.or at least it is still very rough but it will get the job done i suppose :*), my first CLI application :*), tomorrow I'll work on making it look purtier, also Ethan started working on the project again, which filled me with hope. ..I started watching the baby driver movie as well, uhhh gonna try to find Ethan a girlfriend xD, and today went by so quickly, big screen VR added their headset into the app and i just found out that i could cast my computer to the screen there, mind blown 😭,...That's like about all from me tbh, today was a pretty okay day, decided not to spend more time than necessary, meaning spent very little time on the reimbursemfnproject to cool off my head, I'm gonna tackle the pdf feature AFTER I'm done with my ASCII project xD. I really want to get it to a good spot and i mean, i like trying new things, it definitely got me more intimate with how node works, and i learned about child processes, which would help in running command line prompts through code, which is pretty wild and prolly has a lotta applications 👀, new ideas incoming? Maybe a game that you put a file and it hides it In a random part of your file system and you can go find it, different levels of hardness, idk xD not a bad idea tbh, but i want to work with go! So there's a chance I'll be rewriting it all in go, gotta keep up with pise man!! Dr Hill will be on campus for a while so I can talk to him then about what we'll be doing etc etc, maybe he'll want me working on the Google earth engine project 👀👀, that'd be kewl, can't wait for tomorrow's workout, and gonna do Duolingo, read the Bible for a bit, also got five rings by miyato musashasi on my kindle, and head to beeeddd...I ate a lot today too, and watched a lot of archer

    Entry: Today was a very much lazy day, but I'm still learning to focus on myself and what i can do! Moreso i started this project to try to convert videos to like character representation of the videos and i got to a pretty good spot and i can't wait to finalize it, it's gonna be pretty cool, and hopefully it works. I want to start doing some terminal stuff, yknow, branch out a bit, it'll be fun i tells you. I watched the black clover - great movie - and slime movie - less great, pretty okay movie I suppose. Tomorrow's Ethan's birthday and Juneteenth, and the week where I'll be focusing on what I want to do and the projects that I want to work on. The i is supposed to be capitalized like periodt😭😂, but i finished the node course!!!! Like give me a high five! Learned about deno, pretty cool tech, learned more about Graph ql and started the react course, also finished red matter 2 again and scored the only 2 goals in the 2 echo matches i played , today was pretty nice all things considered. Time to jump back into the weekday, good thing Dr Hill wouldn't be here a lot, I'm not gonna be slacking off but it'll mean. No more jump scares at least 😭..Also played a lot of shadow fight, OH MY GOSH I HAVDNT GOTTEN ANY UPDATES FROM MINUTIAE I COMPLWTELY FORGOT EE omg since i removed beta from my phone it had skipped my mind, wow 😭,anyways I'm backkk

    Entry: Started the epiccc black clover movie , it has some sweet animation and it's nice to see the characters again, with their lil blurbs of wisdom, Like at the start of today i was kinda mad and just kept going through over and over in my head how I've been the only one working on a project and others weren't there to help me. Now it's better and i think I'm back to the I'm learning and doing it for my sake phase, but sometimes even after i write code i stills get moments of being shocked that something works well / in a way not explicitly stated, still some bugs go handle, but nothing a good cleanup can't handle ..Also about to tackle on one of the harder tasks, so wish me luck!! Also today I've been telling myself and even believing that i have a lot of potential, not necessarily that I'm letting go to waste, but I'm not capitalizing on it if that makes sense , sometimes i look at websites and the whole idea feels so stoopid, same thing I've been feeling for the last few weeks now, like wanting to do more. Idk if I'd feel like that if i joined another field or started working with new tech, but i for sure do feel like that now :(..It's a bummer yeah, but it's not gonna stop me from continuing learning so 🤷‍♂️. Tomorrow gonna continue the node course with graphql and trh to understand it better, and do the physics lesson in three Js course, it's a long one..Did the three J's scroll one and it was pretty rewarding to see the final result. ..Hmm what else what else what else, i played beat saber and went beast modddeeee on one of the songs, it was super fun xD, also about to finish red matter again!  Ana AND last coding club session was today!!! My summers are back bebeeee. Wow i miss the tranquility of last summer, I'm happy i made an effort to make that summer as chill as possible, good job past me, great job..Didn't resist temptation today but i suppose im fine with it, yeah :/, also beat a 2000 in chess!! And i started watching queens Gambit, which makes chess look really cool xD, the way she visualizes the chess stuff, i wonder if it's similar to how i visualize or try to visualize code, i imagine it's a skill, that'd need developing like any other skil, one thing I'm mainly bummed about is not being able to think of new ideas that'll change the world or sth, maybe i just need to change my pace and focus on sth else, likeeee Google earth engine? Mayhaps. ..I know/ i pray i know that God has given me the gift of either being able to pick up stuff fast, or draw associations with them from things I've learned in the past, and it's something i don't want to go to waste! But yeah as of now i can't do much with my skills monetarily wise. Maybe a theoretical change of scenery will do me good,

    My mood Great
    
    Entry: I'm saying great cause i had not one, not two but three amazing beyond burgers!!! Andre was also there and tbh it was fun hanging out with him, he was checking my computer for messages from Ethan and i was scared he was gonna see Ben's and is messages 😂, that would've been something else. ..Uhh what else what else gave him the phone, i should've signed out of my apps or sth ;-;, i doubt I'm still signed in but whatever. Hmm wow those burgers were good, dinner was good too, was able to get the receipt feature close to done, with decent styling that took hours 😭😭, and working with backend and front end while jumping through 5 files really toughens the character. Anyways TGIF, tomorrow gonna try to play some VR, i miss the days of nice Saturday mornings :*) but whatever,..Also did a good chunk of the scroll based animation part of the three J's course wooo Woop. That's about it from me today tho, ..Adios, I'm gonna work more on the three J's course tomorrow and gonna prolly fix the pdf for reimbursement site tomorrow to keep up my GitHub streak bebe, signup page logic is all essentially done, I've been feeling like I've been working on a solo project for the past week or two now and its a bummer, am i kinda ticked that Ben isn't doing work on it anymore, I'd say honestly yes, but then again i can't stand in the way of someone doing what they want to do. Oooh Monday is a maybe holiday; I'll have to ask Dr Hill, yeah, it's getting late tho, so baiii

    Entry: , rPretty good all things considered, rained, didn't have the best workout but that's fine, had a nice coding session and i think today i made some good progress :D, so sometimes i just have to step back and chill, i also got some good progress on websockets app and deployed it, and did the raycasters lesson in three J's, tomorrow we do scroll based animation. Im just really hoping to get the reimbursement site to a good place before i jump back into the node course, and I'm totally not procrastinating on graph ql😭😭. I need to watch more videos to understand how it works. ..Hmm what else what else, omg sky new cam$era!!! They added a lighting feature. Also, random info, i was able to get my bahnahnah username loll, anyways, tomorrow I'm working on activity receipts feature and j should be able to make some decent progress on it, then I'll unbreak some features get the pdf formatted properly, badabing bada boom baby, then I'll take my well deserved rest and focus on finishing the node course!! ..Archer dis a bob burgers crossover and it was hilarious loll, I'm a big fan of format benders and well done crossovers. Tberes a spider above me and i can't stop looking at it, it's wobbling wayy too much. Ugh I should be about going to sleep, tomorrow's Friday 🥹🥹🥹, TGIAF, I'm planning on getting the fsm data and incremental working by tomorrow, so ill use UMDES to increment it, then test it with FSM interpreter, generate FSM dara and FSM incremental file, then use that in start.m to run simulation, bada bing Bada boom babyyyy...Soar was today too, and there were so many people at tdr, i had to get outta there 😭😭, i don't think i ate too much today, anyways good day all in all,

About to head to bed.now tho, the weather has been decently cold for the past few days which is super nice ..Had a call with oma toran and we planned the potential activities, emailed Dr Qian with a question so i can finish working on the changes tomorrow, i didn't work. On the websockets today but i think I'll continue that tomorrow , i don't want to skip out on learning graphql tjo..And yeah today I went through some challenges with mongoose and mongodb but at least I'm coming out better understanding when to use nested documents how to use references and what the heck a squillon is. Haven't read in a while tho, or listened, one of us is lying is getting more and more pretentious

    My mood Unsure
    
    Entry: I feel like i spent the entire day trying so much and accomplishing nothing, or at least very little, I've been working with the refactoring for the site and just realized that i am probably overengineering for the foapa details and I'm just going to leave it as nested, it's pretty annoying but what can I do ;-;, i have the call with the dude at 9 30 to plan the activities, I'm not as jazzed about it now, but it feels like it's the part of me that wants to live in my comfort Zone that's sissying out on me, so im gonna tell it to shut up and keep my head up. Wow the year is going by fast. ..Dr hill. Isnt gonna be in for a lot of time over the next 2 weeks, and I'm still happy tdr is open. Just got home thank God, and I'm gonna focus on cementing the signup flow and the fooapa information, maybe the reimbursement info as well, gonna push me self to the limit, but it shouldmt be too bad. Oh snap, first I'm gonna change all the images to children site, then I'll work on making foapa nested again,and finish the add foapa page, then tomorrow we'll finish the add reimbursement features

    Entry: Okay, one kinda annoyed right now, but all in all today was a pretty amazing day, tdr is open, lifted a lot on squats and my quads felt biggg, went back to my old room, my happy place, a drone crashed on the door and there are a bunch a random kids with VRs loll, I'm meeting with Caleb, and Andre tomorrow, i think, I'm sure, well i think i left my charger on campus, probably did, hopefully did, so yeah, and the simulations finally working baby!!! ..I'm just a bit annoyed rn cause Dr mina was facing some issues and i already closed my laptop and the rest of the dudes in the team just went Mia, not very useful to put it nicely, then had to submit my dumb coop essay, but it's raining so i shallmt complain..Also made surprising progress on the websockets site, not so much the courses, but i got rooms working and understand more that a socket is essentially a client or like a browser tab, and i also used classes organically, which made me keep thinking about my thought process and how it works but it works so yay

    Entry: Still at random parts of the day I'd get brain fogged, like I'd be thinking of too many things at the same.time and all of them will slip away, but apart from that, pretty normal day, archer is hilarious tho, season 2 xD, chefs kiss. ..Seems.like Juliana found the right files! Oh lawd i hope those work. In other news tho! I watched the first.into the spider verse, pretty good, not ready player one good, but pretty good. Hmm what else what else what else, oh i started some more refactoring on the UDM reimbursement project, i think I've done like a wide scale refactoring more than 5 times now 😭😭 from moving from MySQL to mongo to splitting the front end and backend, but at.least anything for better quality code. Updated my LinkedIn and pise has been missing, but he's making commits so i just imagine he's being worked a lot 😭. Now i don't feel as giddy, well giddy isn't the right word, but like, the novelty of yesterday and the past week or twos situation is wearing off, i don't mind it either ways, gonna give me a clear head, also i may or may not, mostly my have messed up my shoulders dang it Ara 😭😭😭, flipping, uhhh, it doesn't like hurt, like no sharp pain, but it was definitely twisted in a way that it should be, i partly blame triceps extensions, i think I'll switch those for another triceps movement, cable pushdowns is always nice, and rows, ugh rows, my lower back and wrist are just like no thank you, idk if I'll be able to switch them for seated cable rows, i do like seated cable rows, less of lower back pain, but i think the issue is that I'm lifting tok heaby, so ill try to start from 35s on both side and work from there..Also took progress pics today! Also tomorrow i start operation move computer back to normal room!! I miss my happy place 😭😭

    Entry: I still can't describe how i feel from yesterday xD and writing here will make me feel less confused so here we go, i told him errthing, well not literally errthing but a lot of parts of myself that i never show anyone, and he took it pretty well, considers it a sign of close friendship,which i do agree with, being open and talking about stuff like that, but my discovery of his, abilities , that sounds so weird but I'll press on xD, makes me slightly , not even jealous, admiration? And curiosity? I don't even know, well, it was definitely a mix of feelings last night xD, i make it sound like i just had my first time 😂, omg future me is going to have a field day with this, I'm planning on stepping back for about a week, give myself some clear thinking time, so only next Monday. Uninstalling the two apps, a bit too late for today and i hope i can push through, but yeah i don't feel jealousy, at least right now, i did at first tho, just a bit, it's like when i think sth is normal and it's not, and I'm sure it's how Ben sees me when I'm learning stuff or lifting, so i guess admiration yeah, or newly discovered information, which I'm sure he learned about me too. So yeah!! Am i happy i decided to talk about it, kinda yeah, it was an in the moment type decision, but i think it did make our relationship a bit more open, ugh now i sound like I'm dating him. ..I still feel a bit strange, maybe not from the situation at all, a teensy bit of brain fog, maybe from the fact that i sleepy at 12 30 smhhh, yeah the conversation drew long xD, from Nigerian food to, that, but yeah, good talk

And some graduation party for some reason 😭..Then uhh, i can't think of anything else 😭😭, hmm what else what else what else, had to change the api for the UDM reimbursement project cause I'm about to run out of free hours on render :*), ate a lotta.ice cream and kept playing red matter 2, a pretty solitary day tbh, but i was jamming out to the pixel ring tones earlier. And finding some cool new features, I'm. Loving this more than dumb android 14 😭, but uh yeah, nothing profound tonight, future me, hiiii biii, oh! Crushed a 1900 in chess and gained a bunch of elo, lost some, but net gain, with some great big brain moves too, zat is all

With splendid results, and learned about rest apis and why sessions violate the statefullness constraint, also got the react course which I'll be starting after the node course along with continuing the go course. Hmm ,..Great thing no work tomorrow tho, i can chilll, and hopefully go back to my room alone soon enough 😭, it'd be so nice. No workout today too and i restarted red matter. Was watching mashle and it's actually hilarious. I was too harsh to judge it at first, but uhh that's about it for today, I'm not super sore anywhere which is surprising ,so i guess i can recover well enough or maybe I'm just not training that hard, tdr is gonna be open soon enough tho!! On Monday maybe. Oh oh nasty mold dis a sky stream on twitch with beta for new events in the aurora lobby, it was pretty fun

When I tell you I did absolutely no work for Dr hill, actually today was a great day loll, like Andres invited me to this cyber security thing and it was interesting, we had Panera which was amazingggh, I'm craving it now even 😭, then we went to the lab and did a demo, then from there, like 10 to 2, I then moved to demoing the project for Elaine and Dr mina, Dr mina really liked our progress and Elaine also liked it but had some feedback, there were some moments of them talking over each other xD, but it was nice, I played some more sky and explored a teeny bit more of the new area, dang it's too late for sky live now, I might not be able to get the pants 😭😭, ..I bought Jonass react course tho and was practicing with stripe, it's super overwhelming tobe honest and I'm still confused on how it works, but unless I try to implement it myself, I suppose I'll never know, till I try, maybe I'll build an ecommerce site on go and react, ooh not a bad idea eh? Loll. ..Okay okay what's next, got on a call with Ben and we talked for a few hours, like 2 to 3 lol, then went to eat, didn't get to the three js course but I responded to Dr Qian, yay, and tomorrow first thing is gonna be three course, but Dr Hill might come to check in 😭, dang it I'm surely going to finish the haunted house tomorrow. ..Ben was overstating my potential again, and like whatever I suppose 😭,..I had a dream where I was talking with Irene and we were bonding a lot ! Then I woke up :(

    Entry: XHonestly I'll say great just cause sky released their new season and it's freaking beautiful, also finished verification feature in like 30 mins to an hour. Todays coding in Matlab for research was terrible and stagnant ;-;. Error after error with no pattern really, literally only created a launch file ;-; ..But coding the verification feature made me feel productive, slightly productive at least, also had a meeting with Dan, talked about working for him, i nee to actually be proactive about this ;-;. ..Anywayssss, uhhh i totally didn't use my mini tape rule to measure the bathroom in prep of, you know what 😭, I'm not at the proudest moments in my life 😅🥹, but uhh, i did learn sth in Vue with reactive not being able to be changed directly as it would break the reactivity, and we can use object. Assign, but yeah it stumped me and made me feel like how i usually feel when i thought i understood sth but realize i don't, like, feeling betrayed, but dood i have to tell you, the sky new season area is so freaking cool I'm typing so fast but it has everything i want 😭😭, it's amazing!!!??..I took so many pictures but i can only choose 3😭😭, expect spams tomorrow!! But I'm sleeping early tonight, no more 11 30, 10 30, push day today was intense, i had literal jelly arms, i was over worrying about over head press form and i might practice mode tomorrow lol, but yeah tomorrow's first pull day, we will see how it goes. Also left my left headphone in the car :*). And had a loft burger without fries, which made me sad cause i wanted something to snack on, but tdr is opening next week babyyyy...Played sky with nyny too if i didn't mention it, and we couldn't see each other's messages 😭, but uhh, yeah prolly gonna be soreee tomorrey,didn't get to watch the three Js course or node course, we are doing stripe now and i want to actually follow along, then we get to the real fun part! Just uninstalled brave, cause you know why. Off to bed now though l, cyaa. Oh and Dr Qian sent an email but i didn't respond and now i feel bad 😭, first thing tomorrow would be responding, then maybe helping Ben with the bugs he's getting? We haven't made an entire ton of progress on the site but we are still progressing, tomorrow we meet with Elaine at 2! ..I really do need a sky activity cause it do be making me feels happy, and i cant wait for project aviary

So i suppose its a win! Yeah it's a win! It's the start of new things for lil ol me, not really xD, but did a lesson in three Js and tried to do a ml course from the Google drive, twas boring and impractical so stopped, went on to the go course which does look better than the rest, so yeah golang! It can't do ml tho, but.pythons easy to use so ill be fine, i hope. .Another work day tomorrow, i still miss my normal room😭😭😭 I'mso awkward around Andres ..Also casually almost forgetting to mention going shopping which was fun and to hibachi which was less fun '*). Food was quite weird , 5/10  :( gonna finish and round out ibt changes tomorrow. That's how I'll start my day. Finish the ibt changes and message her, i hope she doesn't want it so that half would be male half would be female half would be black and half white 😭 honestly it wouldn't be too hard and i can just do it like that to begin with, im sure she would appreciate it

    Entry: Today was such a weirddssss day, like i can't even explain, first i wake up to a dream about Dr Hill rapping like a texan and me being in the dragon ball world flying around?? Then Ben was trying to find my address because he found my zip code cause he had a dream of trying to find my address, then he reveals that he has, shot, in his glasses before, which sent my brain moving on so many levels, then i fleshed out the donut website and i posted it on the three J's forum, waiting for it to be approved, hopefully ;-;, and get some feedback etc etc, ..Was looking into learning go, even though I'm still juggling through learning other things, continued with the ibt changes for UCSC and I'm almost done, just need to test things out and make sure everything's good! Hmm what else, then i watched Madea a homecoming, which was VERY hilarious like i feel Ike tolkien from southpark, it has no business being that funny xD, going to hibachi restaurant tomorrow so that would be fun, flexd in front of the mirror a bit and i can see them back muscles coming in, even though I never really cared about them before, i suppose they do play a role in an aesthetic physique, I've been putting off taking progess pics so i can measure from before the program and after etc etc. Uhhhh what else..Went to Eden and played a buncha sky, hmmmm, i was thinking of sth too, I've been wanting to create things other people would use and be amused by, I'm still thinking of getting into blender and 3d design. If one more person uses it, and maybe stars the repo, some random person started watching it on GitHub, person doesn't even follow me or anything xd,but yeah uhh i don't wanna go back to working in the hot office, i miss the old room 😭😭😭, but thats a problem for Monday me, I've overstayed my awake ness but i wanna pee  :*) and it's already tomorrow ..Ok mission finished, I'm boutya head to bed,oh i was gonna say meta teased a lot of new games and aot was one of them!! So was i expect you to die 3..But uhh, yeah that's all from me folks

    Entry: Today was a semi slow day, i think my mum's going to work tomorrow, maybe? Hopefully so i get to play me some VR and be a bum for a while, i started and finished the magic donut of fate today and I'm super happy with it xD, i also almost essentially finished the changes Dr qian wanted me to make loll, just need to set up firebase, which imma do tomorrow, email her maybe Sunday so she can see and test things out, Bada bing Bada boom, maybe, surely work on the rewriting again 😭😭😭, but uhhh, yeah didn't workout today, I'm no longer sore, either I'm not pushing myself enough or I'm just too good loll nah, but my body was so pumped, especially my triceps last workout, it was insane, ..Training for strength usually gives no pump, sometimes soreness on a tough day, but I'm usually generally not sore, i only sweat on like deadlift days 😭, and thei usually don't feel the burn, just the weight, so I'm more hindered by the swollen feeling of the muscles, the blood coursing through them, and so on, compared to strength training, i like this profraM a lot tho, And i can't wait to actually run it full time and see the progress i make. I still don't really get the hype behind back muscles, but oh well, they'll be hidden anyways under a shirt, but so are most other muscles, wutevaa. ..I'm gonna fleshen out the donut site tomorrow xD, i have some Easter eggs i want to add..Also worked in the room with Andres and the other dude, it was super warm and i had to get this dumb sugary lemon drink 😭, anyways, i don't have a lot more to say tbh, played some sky, im really saving up for the cape. Half the world away is still stuck in my head ;-;

    Entry: Today ZIOOOMED, this week ZOOOMED, like I'd be chilling or doing something absent mindedly and just realize that a bunch a time has passed 😭😭, but that's all in the past, got a new audiobook, a free Spanish one from audible but the vocabulary might be too complicated for now,..The weather is steaminggg, but uhh didn't do much in research work till Juliana came in, then moved work spaces to where Andres and the other dude are 😭, which i guess is a bummer so i can't work alone anymore 😭, but I'll be back at my happy spot soon enough, once the drop is working, didn't recognize Juliana at first, but uhh that was very useless information xD. Did a nice three J's lesson and I'm planning on making a magic donut site, like let the magic donut decide your fate type thing but like magic 8 ball with chat gippity, drinking a lotta water now. I'm holding on to a lotta face water weight, i say as i ate a ton of bread and j know bread makes me hold on to water weight for some reason. Also had a burger. It's a small project, like the ones I've been complaining about, but it's a fun practice for  three JS and i can sneak in some Easter eggs..Had to miss the meeting with Dr mina too and Dr bani Taan was there ;-;. We have a buncha changes to make, none of them super big tbh. But for the big news, Dr qian reached out and said that she's collaborating with UCSC and they want to use my site as well, here's to hoping that they actually use it :*). But I'm sure they will, hopefully, i was kicking myself for not continuing the refactoring but whatever i suppose 😭😭, it's still there for me to pick back up on it for once things settle down, it's super late now and I've been doing a good ish job of sleeping earlier, and i do feel myself waking semi refreshed, gonna try to see if I'll be able to wake up refreshed at 11 30 sleep time, alr gotta go now

    Entry: I went full bum mode today xD, once i got back from school, just laid in bed with reddit or chess and turned off my brain, Dr Hill wasn't here today, or at least i didn't see him all 3 times i checked xd, so i didn't get a ton of work done, downloaded blender, did part of the node JS course and three.js, which we are using cools stuff now like materials and next time we are gonna be working on some real cool stuff!!! ..Hmm, now, what else, worked out, it was, pumpy? Is that a word, prolly yes, lol no, but it was tough, but nice tough, like leg pump, the heel Elevated squats really did emphasize my quads, i could feel them, or maybe the higher rep did that, idk but still it felt pretty nice , hmm what else what else, leg curls made me feel like i was gonna get a cramp so yeah none of that next time 😭, hyper extensions for the posterior chain and glutes gain hehe. Tomorrow's a push day, so it's gonna be funnn, I'm sure the pumps gonna be insane loll, gonna see if i can work out at 12 again, the gyms a bit more empty and away from prying eyes...My mum changed her shift so she's no longer gonna be working on Saturday, but! She's gonna change it for working all through Thursday? I still like my Saturday morning VR time 😭😭😭, but yeah there's that. Apart from that, and going full on bum mode, not much to be said today, I'm gonna start taking progress pics again, cause why not! Hmmm yeah the heat is making me lethargic but I'm trying to ignore how unpleasant it is. Also i feel like my jawline is gone ;-;

    Entry: Had a pretty nice dream that ended on a cruise ship! To a semi safe Mexican restaurant, not my words xD, it was a competition that i lost but it was the last round and still got a prize, which i didn't open 😭, then the driver said something in fast Spanish and it took me, or sleeping me a second to decode it, like how did my brain just come up with that and I still needed to think loll, I don't even think my answer was accurate now dad..Also had another dream with axel there where the librarian kept unplugging my computer and she explained why and the library was crowdedddd and I left my laptop and phone and stuff in there, luckily no one stole it lol

    Entry: Almost got through the entire day ;-; but uhh honestly i couldn't say i accomplished much today, but i said i would stop attaching my enjoyment of my day to my productivity, did some more node coding same with three J's, nothing on the reimbursement side, or not much, maybe fixed a bug or two. Apart from that, new workout kinda rules, but is also super fatiguing during the workout, like sweating and half panting 😭😭😭, it's a bummer 😭actually not really, like i didn't get to lift a ton of weight, but i can't be lifting as much as i do for strength anyways, had to drop bench press weight, which is fine, like being able to do 185 for 10 will help my max bench press ofc, and gonna get stronger! Tomorrow's leg day, which is gonna be tougher , maybe not, vamos a ver...Hmm what else, got a challenge to tackle for research work, gotta email Trajan eeee...Also session tokens finally clicked! Something that made me super happy, so instead of just using cookies which we set with set header and is returned with every request, we can instead use sessions, which will create a cookie for us and a db collection for all the sessions to be stored, then when the user makes a request, the Middleware parses the cookie that the session creates and then stores the data in req.session that we can then use, it's a very similar concept to jwts!! Oh i also wanna learn me some.blender

    Entry: Honestly today was a pretty good day, apart from the fact that it was SUCH A BLUR, like i woke up not super early thank God,then started on the node course, did like almost 2 modules and I'm trying to understand how session tokens work but they aren't clicking well, even though tho, we started with mongoose and j learned about refs and populate, hmm and tokens i suppose, also learned about cookies, how to use them with set header and set cookie, and how they're sent with every request, it's pretty basic to understand, session tokens are the ones imma fight over. ..Hmm what else tho, then i got to watching dororo and making Ethan watch dororo hehe, that show is honestly great. Top tier. Then ummm i didn't get a chance to do the three J's course even though I really wanted to, gonna start with it tomorrow, but worked on the reimbursement project and got a lotta big tasks done, edit activity, add fooapa to reimbursement, some additional stylings here and there, pretty happy with it. I'm not gonna do any more big tasks though. ..Umm what else what else, i don't even know what else i did, today went by zooming, i got a haircut, ate some ice cream, ate decently healthy? Yeah why not, can't wait to start my new routine woo;!

    Entry: Super boring over here xd, woke up thank God, side note Ethan sent a Christian YouTuber and i think that's gonna direct the direction of my life for the next week or two lol, but still. Played a teensy bit of sky with nyny and my anxiety to join is reducing slowly, slowly but surely....Hmm what else what else, time went by moderately paced tbf, honestly i don't even remember much, i finished the MVP of the hangout planner app, it's not very user friendly  and i don't like the UI one bit, but it still works and i do say that i want to work on some more side projects, small side projects, but then i usually just end up making them big side projects :*)..Side note i might get inyo newsgroups, fbi pls don't start tracking me lol, but yeah pretty boring over here. No work tomorrow woo! But i should be starting my new program, less woo :(. Did a three js course and watched some node videos, my morivation has slowed down in terms of me already knowing how to do it and just not wanting to write code for the sake of writing code, but yeah im still learning a lot, we are gonna be starting on mongoose soon and learning about classes. This is something that I've not talked about a lot on here but i have been getting pretty nihilistic? About coding, like, i think i talked about it the other day but I'm usually like this skill is useless, what I'm doing is useless, writing things to make a webpage is useless, everything's all useless yada yada yada, but honestly this does give me a chance to help people! Like the reimbursement project, which i wasn't thrilled about at first, but I've come to absolutely love it and i love seeing how it would help Dr mina, even if it only helps Dr mina, and do i feel like I'm carrying the group? Yeah a lotta times, but they are still there to share the load whenever i need them which absolutely indispensable..Oh oh I've continued Sao and it's still pretty good lol, got Eyitooni to watch it too. Nothing super special today tho, like, did some coding, OH I WATCHED READY PLAYER ONE, that movie was amazinggggggg, one of my favorite movies in recent memory,..I found some of my weird minutiae memories too xD and someone had CeraVe which i thought was hilarious..Anyways what's the plan for tomorrow? Well wake up - God willing, get on the node js course, work on receipt checking feature of reimbursement page, clean up pdf and standardize image proportions. That's about it to be honest, work on three js for sure, Wes gonna be working with textures now, which is pretty cool, hmm, continue hangout planner and UI design for deebee, which i don't like that name loll, Velocity is better xD, i just wanna make something that people will use, guess i have to go through the day wondering what else to do, I'll have enough to go around I'm sure, also getting a haircut..Edit..I was just looking at some of my past entries and realized that wow, i have nothing to look forward to, like i was reading about being excited about my mum making turkey and getting the chance to play Roblox and even just thinking about it makes me more light hearted but as of right now, there's nothing i look forward to, not even the littler things, which i suppose is quite a bummer and why I've felt like there's being a weight ish on me, like not as lighthearted as usual, the days look the same and it's usually work or code, or tv, which is no longer sth to look forward to, idk how to feel tbh

    Entry: Got Ethan to watch sonny boy!!! And started sword art online, it's pretty good!! Lol Dan and i started an excel sheet, I'm already 7 episodes in xD. Started the hangout planner app today, and tomorrow I'm gonna see if i can get a nice mvp, i don't love the UI but it's coming together slowly but surely, most things went smoothly. ..Hmm what else, I'm adding a random face pic cause i started using the ceravee and my skin feels pretty smooth, i wanna see the full changes tho, gonna get a haircut on Monday and see how that goes. ..Hmm what else what else, OMG I PASSED SPIN ETERNALLY, i was so gassed and hyped!! Like it was completely luck and my brain and hands were completely disconnected xD, it was super fun tho. Hmm what else what else. I should still keep up styling the app i wanna make with pise cause i can learn a lot from it and i don't want to be the one limiting our progress cause of me laziness, but yeah we'll see, i don't have a lot to say and imma just go slep,

    Entry: Okay good news first, my first CeraVe product came in, tomorrow's Saturday, and I'm gonna test it out woo!! Home alone too maybe after some nice VR, i didn't get much work done today, still chugging along on both courses even though momentum has slowed down a bit, apart from that tho, two prospective students came in and one dude was well versed in computer stuff! Im also gonna start learning how to cut my own hair! Instead of just looking at it and waiting for my dad to come cut it, best do it myself, and maybe mess up a few times 😭, but that's learning for you, anyways...Bad news, I've not been reading but i have been listening to audio books, i guess i should still continue TSAONGAF, but ehh uhh and I'm still struggling with you know what, more than normal, and it makes me super ashamed to read the bible which is kinda stupic, but I'm dumb and aaaaa it just ugh, I've been trying not to overthink it but maybe I'm due for a good overthinking ..Dr Hill also bought lunch for me, and i had me a nice burger! I think it motivated me to start eating lunch xD then my workouts would be AMAZINGGGG, id need to pack some money tho. ..Hmm what else, dood i don't feel like the others are taking the project seriously anymore, for the most part they're just leaving me to do all the word and i decided not to do any work till the rest of them pick up some of the slack, it will give me some free time cause i did come up with an idea for a website, so we'll see how it goes, I've also not gotten a chance to really work on the oee sitez just started the changes this morning 😭😭, but yeah i mean i got some things done, not a lot, i wish i could focus more on it, but i think i am accomplishing the goal i set out the achieve this summr ..- learn react ,or at least dabble in it, cause it's still ew.- learn three.js which was really a pleasant surprise from mantas .- learn node, which I'm super happy with my progress and understanding, i think the course progress for me has slowed because now i think there's not a lot for me to learn, but that's most likely false and i still learn new things everyday so there's that. .- Working on research with Dr Hill .- side stuff like oee project ..So it's a pretty eventful summer for sure..Also played a TONNNN of chess and lost a bunch of elo, gained some back but definitely a big loss

Maybe next time I'll go straight for 300, also planned out the new routine and I'm kinda excited for it, but I'm worried of leaving the comfort of my current routine, which I've gained a lotta strength from, we'll see how this goes, so wish me luck xd

    Entry: Finished forgot password feature and it was working but not sending email addresses to Ethan or Andre 😭😭, also i still smile at this but a random person made a fork of my portfolio and altered it and is using it for theirs, idk for some reason it.makes me happy xD, that's what gives me.pleasure, making something other people will use and find convenience in, so I'm working on a project with pise to build something similar..And dangit Ben, he did his porfolio project and i got curious now and searched portfolio with react and three J's and the first result was his, and now i feel, idk how i feel, no need to dwell on it, moving on lol, I'm still learning three J's don't worry, tomorrow I'll work on making a circle that follows the mouse, i have so many ideas, like, in three.js, first opens with a 3d neon red and black landscape with like 3d goggles effect then as the user scrolls down, the glasses will come off revealing a tech scene where the user can interact and on billboards, my basic information is shown, ofc it'll be a showoff project but I'll also have an easy terminal like portfolio ..Anyways then as the user scrolls down, it'll alternate to a calm serene maybe pixelated sky vibes website with more details, it'll be sweet! Oh before i forget, o finished listening to metamorphosis, terrible book, glad i didn't spend time reading it 😂, an entire book in 3 days, what a steal! Idk if i mentioned previously but I'll be working on a project with pise that will take api data and display it properly, like the details in the api, maybe add analytics, a semi complex app but i tells you it'll be fun, trust me. I'm gonna work on the UI tomorrow, gotta make it clean

    Entry: Okay I've essentially been chilling and playing a bunch a shadow fight lol, i did a lesson of the three Js.course and finished a module in node, but rn I'm just feeling sunk? Like, not necessarily tired, undirected is the best word to use i suppose,, I've been hopping from one thing to another and.now i guess its coming back to bite me and I'm having some brain fog, not like overcast, just brain fog..Like i can't think of anything specifically, just a fog 😭, anyways, gonna get over it eventually, Andres here and I'm watching his stuff for him, i was gonna say sth but forgot ugh, oh i may not be able to get paid for working, i prolly wouldn't, and I'll just tell Dr bani Taan that, it's.not.like he'll be like noooo don't work, or force me to stop working, if i was in his shoes, I'd feel bad for not being able to compensate my student but it's a fault of neither of the parties, so, i kinda was looking forward to taking away money from like 2 semesters next, but que será será, i think that's what's partially contributing to my brain fog, not super sadness, just like, mild sad xD, the comic sans of emotions i suppose, its a bummer and bummmers happen, they prolly needed to fill out a W2 form, soooo yeah, vex just texted about the tax man lol and i kinda mini ranted to him, which i suppose makes me feel better now, i gotta tell Dan about finishing childhoods end..After this, I don't have a ton to do in terms of research with Dr Hill, waiting for our meeting with Juliana tomorrow, so i think I'll work on the forgot password part, rn I'm leaning towards sending the user like a key, it'll redirect them to the forgot password page, tell them they should check their email or sth, normally i was planning on generating a link and sending it to them, then they'll be able to use that link and the users data token will be passed as a route.param, when they then click thenlink, yeah there are different ways of doing it, I'm done for now tho, cya

    Entry: I learned so much new stuff about deploying and structuring websites over the past two days, one, the front end and backend should be split ideally, into different folders is good, and each will have their package.json to manage dependencies and prevent clashing, it probably will also make setting up typescript wit node much easier, and i can use common Js imports without conflicting with the UI portion ..Side note Dr Hill met my dad today and he wouldn't be on campus tomorrow, woo!..But umm, i made good progress ish on the fsm project ,slightly debatable but ehh we ain't gonna talk about it. Hm what else, yeah back to deploying, then instead of using res.sendfile which is more common with SSR like ejs and handlebar type stuff, we can just operate the front end server normally and then also run the backend server at the same time, so when a change is madr in the front end, it reloads like normal, same.with the backend, that thought makes me so happy xD, everything is just sliding into place! Same with deploying the app so that i can do the link/some link, it works now which is amazing, then in the api calls, i do localhost8080/api/... As that's where the api is getting served for the backend and when it's hosted, the link would change, it makes a ton of sense and just made life a whole lot easier, didn't do a node course today, and started listening to audiobooks, specifically metamorphosis by Kafka, cause why not, and i mean I'm enjoying it, imma be listening to them while working out and imma try to find some good Spanish ones, reading physically has lost its charm for me unfortunately, maybe j haven't found the right book, but i much like being able to listen to books even though I kinda was a gate keeper on physical vs audiobooks at the start :*)..We learn and grow, anyrays, nothing much spectacular happened, pretty chill normal day, finished childhoods end and Ethan finished over the garden wall! Mum made moinmoin yesterday too..Workout wasn't the best tho, was super hungry and had a headache

    Entry: Pretty normal day, chill, did some coding against my not better judgement xD, spent some time working on the reimb project then flushed out Minim(, which pise helped me learn to deploy better! Apparently it's better to split the front end and backend into different folders so they can be deployed separately instead of serving the front end files on the server, so i use vercel to host the front end, then render to host just the backend like the node stuff, then render serves as just like that api that i connect to through the url it gives us, which is a pretty interesting way to do it and a way i definitely need more practice in 😭..Anyways went to aurora concert with nyny and lama, twas nice, ate a lot for dinner and finished a season of infinite train, started another show childhoods end or sth, did a three Js lesson where we learned to animateee..That's about it for today

    Entry: Today was honestly pretty nice, woke up at like 8 so both parents had gone to work, then decided not to do any coding, step away from if for a while, and just scrolled on social media for a long while, then played some VR, joined the coding club call, dang i almost forgot i do need to work on stuff for it as well, error handling, but yeah, then went to Dans house!! ..Played half life alyx which is a pretty good game, got motion sick when i took the headset off tho 😭, but got some pizza. Then some random people started showing up, one dude that looked like jimmy showed up, thought it was him but noope...Anyways apart from that, it was like a hookah party 😂😂, anyways, had some talks about philosophical stuff omg that word took me so long to remember xD, ate some good food and some medium steak and had to keep reminding myself, meat juice, it's meat juice MEAT JUICE...Apart from that tho it was pretty chill, then got home, finished the second season of infinite train which now i think i like better than the first one, it came to a happy end which was so nice to see, still touched by over the garden wall tho, was listening to it's soundtrack, anyways got to coding the fooapa stuff and made some good progress with some beautiful code if i may say so maself, maybe not the most optimized, but i suppose the most practical, well the more i think about it, it's the most condense piece of code that wouldn't have to handle adding new reimbursement, saving reimbursements etc, the code works and a nested for loop never hurt anyone..Also I'm staying off GitHub mostly cause ik I'm just gonna be overwhelming myself to work faster slash better and nope, i do not want that, anyways gonna dangit i fell into my own trap, gonna try to get a good portion of Minim finished for it's first launch :)..Also project aviary on sky is a real thing??? EEEEEE

It has a great story and some great characters, just thinking about it fills me with the same emotions i get after reading an amazing book, it wasn't very long, but every second was amazing 😭, started another show called the infinite train, it's.not as good as otgw but it has its moments, spent a long time on campus today and got some good work done, the incremental files semi work, it took a while but yay ..Why do i feel bleh? I feel like snuffed out, i don't like saying I'm burnt out 😭, but I'm usually coding mindlessly,like i wanted to dedicate time to just watching infinite train but found myself working on reimbursement project  and trying to think of how to approach changing the foapa initial and current amount

    Entry: Okay so there was a big change in the sky server, Betty wanted to split the server to make it so that just those on the server initially stayed, so now we are cut down to like 20 people, just the ogs and now it's nice again xD, i don't have to be worried about joining in on strangers conversations, spamming of Owo gifs and so on, it's super nice and motivated me to block a bunch a people i don't know in the actual sky game so i don't panic over running over some random person i have chat unlocked with them scrambling to run away. ..Just the good ones can stay hehe, and AND SKYS COMING TO PC AAAAAAA, DOOD When I saw the news i got so excited 😂😭, maybe Ethan will be able to play sky now hehe, I'm super hungry, well i had beef jerky, found 10 dollars in me pocket thank God, so now heading home, and gonna eat something substantial, workout was okay, not eating kinda messes up the vibe, but I'm trying to get back to where i was and develop a routine. My routine rn is ..- Wake up and get ready .- Head to campus .- Work on node js course .- Work on internship till about 3 30, we're getting into the more complicated stuff now .- Workout .- Work on reimbursement project/head home and continue on reimbursement project .- Chill a bit .- Watch three js course .- Slep..Dood i still haven't texted jimmy aAAAA, okay I'm gonna do it once i get home, i was able to finish the riveron task, so yeah

    Entry: Feeling pretty good today, and i guess being busy is my new normal, or at least having one thing that sucks a buncha my time 😭😭, aka internship, 10 weeks feels like a long time, relatively i suppose im focusing on the wrong thing and not enjoying the process, meh the process is fine, could take it could leave it. Worked a bunch on the reimbursement project and wowee my chests are sore, nice to be lifting again! Didn't lift as much today tho, I'm gonna have to start finding a way to get a meal in cause i be hungry. ..Went to a hotdog thingy and met someone named Andres and some other dude i forgot his name, it was pretty awkward at first and duuuuuuudddddeee i feel like i forgot how to smile 😭😭, I'm worrying way too much about whether the smile is genuine or not and it's annoying 😭😭😭😭, i just gotta smile and get out of my way, also idk how much time i can dedicate to reading nowadays, and I'm reading the subtle art of not giving a f and i think audiobooks will serve me better than real books :*), I've also been listening to a lot of munecat songs lol...I have to be on campus tomorrow and I'll try to see what days i can stay home, I'm still getting assimilated with the software and stuff so i suppose i understand. Didn't work on Minim ;(, but i did work on the node js course, started off the day with that, hmmm. What else what else what elseeee. i think that's it, meeting with Dr mina tomorrow was postponed and i believe i can finish the signup page changes by tomorrow, wish me luck. That's about it from me?started watching the Mario movie as well

    My mood Meh
    
    Entry: Today was a super busy day, super packed day!!! I think i stared at code for almost the entire of today, i don't mind too much but i know it's not sustainable, essentially got an email from Dr Hill talking about meeting at 9 30, i didn't know it would be in person 😭😭, so there's that, then i head to campus, he talks about his research etc etc, i practice with the software and finish a Matlab tutorial, which Matlab is pretty easy or at least i got exposed to the easy parts, so that was fun, I'm gonna ask him tomorrow if i should track my hours and if it's necessary, also gonna give him the old laptop and talk to him about paying for another semester, also got a key i put in my glasses case!! Future me don't forget xD. ..But umm, yeah i saw Ben and we talked, no hard feelings at all, still friends as usual. Didn't play any vr today which i do admit bummed me 😭, and sitting in that room is boringggg, and my back started to hurt lol, but at least some parts of what i was doing/learning was interesting. ..Anyways after that got home and hopped on a call with Dan, i didn't eat a lot for the entire of today! Like 2 meals, but yeah talked to dan about internship stuff, he can't pay us a lot with gift cards which is a bummer, i could be making bank right now but I'm still in a very fortunate situation so I'm not super salty. But after the gym, which fun fact i spotted a random dude and he talked to me for a few seconds and he kept looking at me and i kept looking at him like i knew him or like he knew.me, idk.chico, no sé, then after that worked on the reimbursement project, sadly i didn't get a chance to work on Minim or chat with Jimmy, wow i was busy. But then i got the THREE JS Course FROM MANTAS AAAAA, SO LUCKY WEEEEEEE, i can take the courses and become a master 3d dev, which got me thinking again but I'll save some of that for later. ..I watched like 10 to 15 mins to the node js course, having to head to campus in the morning screwed up the routine a bit, but if ill be leaving before 8 and getting to campus at like 7 50, i can get working on it before 8, like good times last summer when i was in that room working with the electrical stuff, then once I'm done with the node course, i can jump on the three Js course, which i uploaded to next cloud and kept crashing the wifi lol, or maybe i can altermate days to focus more on one than the other, idk if my attention span is too spontaneous/trash for that lol, also i think pixel fixed a bug with typing and me constantly having to scroll up, cool! ..Uhh haven't played sky with frens in a while :(, but yeah back to my dilemma, i was wondering as usual and thinking about how learning 3d stuff is useless, in my head I'm like ai is the future and anything not ai is stupid, partially motivated by a certain fellow but that thought it Stoopid tbf,i love the look of websites like that and i have a plan for a cyber punk esque but a chill also place in my website with three Js, that's my end goal, and when i think about it, i feel like websites are pointless and just pages on a screen but so is so many things!! And my life mostly revolves around websites, i have so many tabs open, all websites working with web technology and i could work to making those tech cooler, idk rn I'm focusing a bit too much on the grand scheme of things, everything is fleeting and I'm like, this is prolly the fleetingest of things, but I'm just gonna shut my brain up for now and listen to mi corazon

    Entry: Okay I'm feeling a lot better now, we resolved our differences and he's back to working with the team, ugh that was a pretty stressful day, anyways played vr chat and found a nice place that i made my home, wrote my frustrations away for the most part and talked about how i wouldn't want someone to pursue their goals when I'm pursuing mine and feel happy doing so, also mantas has the three.js course!! Ofc my three Js desire is fueled with a teensy bit of spite to light the fire, but spite gets the job done don't it...So once.im able to get access to it, i can continue, also got a bunvha the ai features to a basic level right now, and im.close to a nice mvp

    My mood Meh
    
    Entry: EFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, EFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF..Edit, i should prolly give more context, i was looking at Ben's repository and it looked like he's been working on a ton of projects, which you know how it makes me feel, but i just decided to read Ecclesiastes and I'm realizing how misguided i am? I guess that's the good word, or focusing on the wrong things, whenever i move further from God, i find it easier to be caught up in other people and my own mess, which is something i strongly dislike, but reading it, it's like everything passes away, quite nihilistic, and it does make my problems feel small which is nice,i was about to go on an entire spite motivated learning of three Js, but nahh I'm not gonna do that xD, for now at least 👀👀, I'm gonna continue my day as normal, i wanna start integrating ai features into Minim!! The exciting part is starting now eeee I'm really proud of the project, I've only been working on it for a week and I've already come pretty far, i could.peobably already start beta testing after next week!
    
    Entry on 2023-05-13
    My mood Conflicted
    
    Entry: Ok conflicted was a much better emotion to use, but I'm back here with some updatessss,gonna try to make this one as optimistic as possible ,talking with vex and pizza helped, it was nice to get feedback instead of just talking to myself lol, anything i wanna say to myself, i try to stop it cause i don't wanna, well why the hek not, why am I bei, nah even saying it doesn't sound like me, i was gonna ask why i was being villainized for pulling the slack from the team, i could finish the project on my.own and do all the tasks, well no that's being prideful, i do really enjoy their feedback and talking to them so i guess not, so moving away from the morality and the blame of the situation, I'm sure when i wake up tomorrow, I'll be feeling a lot better, but yeah uh i forgot my train of thought, yeah i talked to vex, i feel better now, not amazing, but better than before, watching southpark helps too lol..Hmm yeah I'm gonna continue with the changes and not let anything slow me down, if Ben leaves, then I'll pick up the slack and get the job done as usual, i looked on his GitHub and saw that he has been doing projects and ofc i did have to stop myself from feeling threatened and writing it here also makes me feel better about it, but i think I'm in a good spot now, if he was talking about it in person, dood idk if my facial expressions would reveal how i feel.xD, the summer is just beginning omg, and this is nothing like last summer 😭😭, i should read some notes from then lol, nostalgia plays tricks on everyone, and i guess i did and still do like the trajectory of where this summer is going, I'm learning more backend skills and that's something to feel happy about, understanding middlewares, authentication, at a very basic level but still understanding, working on a functioning website with pretty fast speeds, and if someone's working on sth else, who am I to judge, like i said in. A previous entry, we all have goals and are pursuing said goals, so who am I to stop someone from pursuing theirs, i wouldn't want someone to always feel bad when i learn something new! And maybe they do! Maybe everyone l around me just feels how i constantly feel when i feel/see others progressing, but i can never say for sure and like i talked about before, i can only focus on my life, which is the only thing i can control, now i feel less conflicted ..The general theme is that we all have goals and motivations, and intentions. I didn't intend for this to happen but I can't change the past and can only control how i react to it, and now I'm choosing to react in a, que será será manner, he's gonna work on his side projects, I'm gonna work on mine, along with the project, it's going to be amazing, i tells you :D, so I'm just gonna keep my chin up, stretch a lil and not ruin my day by overthinking things, deep breaths
    
    Entry on 2023-05-13
    My mood bad
    
    Entry: Idk if bad is the emotion, angry, guilty probably, I've been debating writing here about it but it seems like it's escalating so why not, so essentially Ben said he wanted to work on the mongo migration and i was completely fine with that, but then woke up today and forgot all about it, so spent a buncba while working on the migration, came though some bugs etc etc, and finished it all, then Ben was like he wanted to work on it as well, and then i did feel bad about doing it and offered to rollback my changes as i don't want him to leave the group, but it seems like he is still bent on leaving the project as it has left a bad taste in his mouth, leaving me, which i admit, is pretty selfish of me, but leaving me with the guilt of being the one, or the stick, that broke the camel's back which i don't want, at all. ..I do recognize that a lot of it is my fault, and in this case, it was a honest mistake and if he wants to leave, then i suppose I will respect his decision, i was just saying yesterday about how this is all pointless in the grand scheme of things, i wish i didn't go on the schpiel about how i don't live in the grand scheme of things, but over the long run i suppose this will just be another project and i am placing a lot of importance on it when that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. Another reason why I'm worried is how Ethan and Andre will see me as a result of being the one who made him want to leave the project, but I do believe that they'll understand that it was an honest mistake and maybe Ben's decision to leave was something he thought more about in the past and this is just the opportunity he is using. Which now to be selfish to be fair i don't even understand, last semester he focused more on other classes and took on a role without communicating that he didn't like the role aftr the semester was over, we went past that, nothing immediately comes to mind of him saying he wants to work on sth and me taking over without his permission, he wanted to work on firebase and I left it to him,..Ughh it's so frustrating!!! And Stoopid!!!! I do admit working alone would be so much nicer ;-;..At least Andres backing me.up and hopefully it'll help, okay, I've told him that I'll just respect his decision, not in those words, but he says he can't do it, okay why not just let it all out here, gonna take a step back..Ok edit, seems like we can't change his mind, and I'm pretty sure this will affect oir friendship some way or the other, I'm not fond that I'm the one who caused him to not work on the project anymore, but what has happened has happened and i can't change the past, i guess people change, life's too short for this ;-;
    
    Entry on 2023-05-12
    My mood Unsure
    
    Entry: Not much to journal today, and I'm not in the mood to :(, just want to be brutally honest in my journals, played a lot of attack on quest and some echo, worked out and felt JACKED today, might have just been the pump tho, most likely the pump, tomorrow SCP meeting, I'm not in the mood to read design patterns, they lost me. ;-;. Hm what else what else. Had a meeting with Dr mina but didn't have one with Jimmy cause I'm dumb and didn't let him know but good news Dr bani taan said i could get tuition remissed for the summer which is kewlll, but still yeah ...Then something that has been on my mind lately is how useless coding is slash the skill of coding in the long run or like as a whole, in the greater scheme of things, but then again, i don't live in the greater scheme of things nor does life run in the greater scheme of things, i choose what i want to dedicate my time to and fine-tune my craft and if it means spending hours coding and learning about code, then so be it, i don't have to impact the world or constantly think about the greater scheme of things, I'm not getting any younger and by the time future me is reading this ( in Alie wards voice, heeeeeyyyyy ), I'll be looking back on this moment with - insert emotion future me. I just have to be one step better than yesterday, learn one more thing ,and so on . We all have goals and I'm happy when i chase mine but threatened when other people do and it's Freaking stupid, i don't feel threatened right now, but trust me, you've already seen my past entries, maybe I've attached my self worth so much in doing more than other people, being better than other people at most things that when someone comes along and does something new for themselves, i spiral and i hate the feeling every freaking time, every freaking time. God help me :*)..The human brain is a very complex device, i feel happy when good things are happening to me and even happier when my brothers around so i can subtly flex it in his face, why? I don't even know! I've engrained the doing more than everyone mentality that I've already started associating if to more people, like they would feel bad if they see me doing more stuff like i feel bad when i see other people.doing more stuff, which is STOOOOOOPID. Why should they feel bad, what i do LITERALLY doesn't affect them or their life in ANY WAY and vice versa!! The same way what i do is usually localized to me, why do i always blow things out of proportions aaaa, I'm remembering when my brother used to play Fortnite and some times I'd sorry that hed get really good and popular for it, like that's stupid! Right? I don't even know at this point, i only have myself as a point of reference, and i could be the only one in the world who recognizes my behavior as far as i know, there's a 109 percent chance that that isn't the case, but still! Side note, i finished the movie gringa and it was pretty good, but! Yeah and even sometimes i reaffirm myself that thoughts are just thoughts and thoughts don't control who i am but to an extent they do, they control how i perceive other people and how i act towards them and i. A way, how i act towards myself, which sounds dumb as well but that is the case, I'd judge others and then it just makes me judge myself harder, so what do i get out of all this, not relief, that's for sure, just maybe getting one step closer to cracking the mystery egg juice that's my brain..Guess i was in more of a mood to journal than i thought, my brain feels light, some more brain juice squeezed out for sure

    Entry: Watched a movie called missing and it was really good! Good news as well, we were approved for funding for our reimbursement project Woop Woop!! 12 dollars an hour for 40 hours which is pretty nice! 1980 or 20 dollars in full, which is amazingggggg...Umm what else what else, id have to talk to Dr bani taan about getting paid with tuition reimbursement 😭, i have to check my school mail as well!

Anyways, yeah I'll tell my dad tomorrow, he's prolly going to work so I'll ask my brother prolly if he's going to campus, anywayssss..Hmm what was i thinking, lost my train of thought, yeah also started another movie called gringa or sth, hmm, it's pretty good pretty good, played attackonquest and I'm slightly better at it, uhhhh, played echo as well, I'd prolly have said great for my mood today but i came across a paralyzing in quotes bug in react that's making me not able to progress ;-;, and that's a big bummer, it's Stoopid and it's making  me not like react anymore xD, tbf i didn't really like react, i much prefer Vue and it's niceties, so much nicer omg, i can't imagine using svelte loll, but yeah Vues ugh so much, anyways no drooling, I'm gonna get better at react and maybe I'll come to love it, maybe not, prolly not. Still taking the node course tho! And the cyber security stuff has definitely slowed down 😭, i gots go keep up with the stuff. ...Last night i had one of those moments where i was thinking about death and how it'd feel, cause chuckuemekas dad died, well, idk how recently but still yeah, and yeah , it's pretty crazy so, yeah :*), enough bad weird news, didn't do Les Mills today, shoulder needed the break, eye twitched like twice today, success?..I haven't read yet, and frankly a bit scared to read lol, i haven't been enticed by much since lord of the flies.

    Entry: Pretty good boring Day, woke up.super early And fixed the change Dr mina had for our project before 12, watched some bobs burgers and almost finished a module in the node course, then tried to make dutch babies from bob's burger but it turned out terribly just terribly 😭. Anyways, uhh, dis a 25 min Les Mills workout!! I think that was my longest ever, it was super tough, I've gotten better at my punches i think, but i had a LOT of ice cream, a bucket ton 😭..In other news tho, had a call with Jimmy, Wes was working on the design system, it's coming together quite nicely. Next I'll be working on the button component in ma free time mañana. I still need to tell my mum about the SCP meeting on Saturday, ugh I'd still need to be telling her about stuff regardless even when i can drive, maybe i can just send her messages, it would be easier :*). Anyways, i haven't read in a while, the book I'm reading is terrible and nothing's bringing me back to reading it, the stories are kinda boring, and they're short stories, if it was in another language I'd be more tolerant i guess, but dang that would mean i can't finish the book a month challenge, or maybe i can  👀..Anyways I'll find a new book, but like I mentioned before, luckily we were able to get all the changes done for Dr mina, the eye twitching is still there and annoying as ever but wuteva, played VR aot and bad a fun echo game! Lost, but it was still super fun. Then played population one, ..Oh oh I'm forgetting something i was bored and looking for something to watch so chose he's all that, the movie everyone was saying was trash, and even though it has some absolute cringe moments, im enjoying it!! My standards are just super.low i guess xD..I haven't been able to remember my dreams in a while :*), I'll choose a Spanish book for my next book, don't wanna fall behind in the practice because I'm writing here in English again and i still feel like my expressions and how i can describe my. Day have greatly improved, even though I could have said all that including this en Espanol

    Entry: I feel a lot better than yesterday loll, still had periods of laziness but i learned and grew a lot today, learned about jwts and used them! Used mongoose schemas and models, so you use.mongooae to create a schema then create a model out of the schema, then we can use the model to interact with the db collection, its pretty cool, finished the sign up and registration and authentication flow of the website, worked with middlewares too which was great! Feeling super proud of what i learned,then Dr mina sent us changes about feedback to our app and they're all stressing out about it but i think we'll be fine xD in other news, ..My brother got his car, that's something, went shopping with my mum, finished i expect you to die, felt like such a genius with the last mission. Then played beat saber and had a nice Les Mills workout! Then watched a buncba bob burgers episodes and got some good laughs outta me, now I'm about to head to bed 😂😭, texted jimmy and we are going to work on the design system tomorrow, so i wouldn't have a buncba free time, gonna be doing a lotta coding, at least gonna be home alone as well woo!!, At least relatively, wish me luck xD

On the bright side, it doesn't take a lot of work to maintain muscles, just to grow it so i could focus on maintaining for tomorrow my plan is to continue the node course, continue with the nice cyber games tutorials, hmm, and that may be it, i don't want to over burden myself as in the past few days, these have been super busy days, not the busiest of my life I'm sure, but quite busy

And you already know how i react to people around me doing new things, ugh i hate this, hate feeling threatened by other people knowing fully well that i shouldn't be! I need me a therapist. For now, deep breathes

Hmm what else, did some react coding with Jimmy, and by me self. Worked on the riveron project - had coding club, and worked on canron project as well, but that was about it, then i suddenly felt a wave of laziness and semi boredom, like i didnt want to do any work and felt smi burnt out, for like a few but then i got better, calmer

I always imagined react to be super difficult, but alas I've only really scratched the surface ..Hmm what else what else, had to be on 2 calls at the same time and got Canton calls at 2, i still need to ask my parents if i can do an internships with Daniel omg ..But there was a period in the middle of the day where no one was home except me and it was super quiet and calm, i got a chance to talk to myself a lot and just recenter, and i also bought i expect you to die!!

I'm so happy it goes through a lot, and i mean A LOT of the things i want to learn , by this time next year, future me you better be a node master ┌⁠(⁠・⁠。⁠・⁠)⁠┘⁠♪..Gonna take things one step at a time, then we'll find our way, in the project, the Canton project, we decided fully to use Ali's template which was very fine with me i love the design and animation, tomorrow I'll update the figma to match, should be great...Omg i haven't played Roblox in the longest time cause of my computers bum trackpad lol, i need a mouse, we probably have one lying about. Hopped on a. Call with Ben and Andre and we talked coded and debugged for a while, I'm working on the landing page for the site and it's coming together swimmingly, the react syntax looks less like Greek to me and i kind of like how things are structures..ALSO HAD A CALL WITH MANTAS, his British accent isn't super pronounced lol which reminds me, jimmy said i had an accent yesterday i think, i didn't know it was still that noticeable but at least it makes me happy xD. ..Hmm what else what else what else, watched a buncba Simpsons episodes omg i watched the episode that was a reference to lord of the flies! I never noticed it before but it was hilarious 😂, nelson stealing millhouses eyeglasses, the conch, the beast, their chanting omg 😭😂 the extra depth made it more hilarious . ..I've still been listening to how to Spanish for working out but with the bum workouts, tomorrow's a rest day, i have to figure out the exercises that are good for me and the ones that aren't, handstand push-ups and pullups are a big go, i didn't find anything good for legs, no place to do nordic curls, hmm the reverse ones maybe, but my knee had a big pop and started to hurt , doing a warmup with Les Mills made everything feel buttery smooth tho, it was pretty nice..Gonna go read now, cya later

    Entry: Okay to start from now going backward, well i can start from the beginning of today, today was a VERY VERY productive day, so started off working on the figma of the Canton connect while watching a sandbox video but got super bored of the video lol so finished the schema and it looked decent. ..Then started work on it laddeee da, everything was going pretty smoothly, then i worked out! The workout started out pretty good, nothing can replace the gym, then it got worse, couldn't do horizontal pull, wrist hurt from handstand, general fatigue, ended up ending it early, tomorrow's a lower day, doing upper lower rest upper lower with some VR cardio thrown in periodically. Maybe every 2 days, played some intense beat saber songs today(⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠), but I'm getting side tracked so let me continue..I feel like a big chunk of today is missing, but then i started trying to get image storage in the UDM reimbursements project to work but that was a bust and we are doing another approach, anyways continuing, well no staying with that, no continuing, I'm tired of drama. Got on a call with Dr Hill, he can pay me for 400 hours yayy, 12 dollars an hour, i dont mind it to be honest, he gave me the tasks and i didn't feel overwhelmed, God will help me through and some of them sound genuinely fun. ..Then got on a call with Jamal and we talked and he showed me his codebase and i Met someone from China in sky beta and we talked and it was nice talking to a stranger, like a clean slate, but i don't want my fear of coming across friends to follow with beta ugh, idk why i feel like this xc,he showed and talked me through the onboarding experience and it is A LOT!!! speaking of which I've not told the duckateers why ive been so busy and I've been constantly debating in my head if i should or not, like, i don't want to make them feel inadequate at all, i know I'd feel somewhat inadequate if dr mina chose one of them for something and not me, and then getting the opportunity to work on some other stuff, ik if i tell, i would feel kinda dirty, but holding on also feels kinda dirty, like i don't feel like they're good enough, I'm definitely just ranting now. ..But hmmm, what else, now for the pies de resistance, well before that, watched some Simpsons episodes,then continued physical 100 and dood the drama is so nice and palpable, not as dramatic as the telenovelas but it did give me a touch of the emotions i used to feel 😂, maybe i should start watching telenovelas again, but anyways, that plan was to start refactoring the code, learn more about node and the best practices, i was going to buy the node course, and i still should and probably will! But anyways, hmm, yeah the code wasn't working at all and spent a few hours with little progress, tomorrow's most likely going to be like this as well for the most part, I really want to be able to set up node and ts but we'll see..Off to bed now tho, i might read just a teensy bit..Edit ..Sometimes these daylio quotes are just spot on! But they reminded me of something, when i finished coding for the day, i got a sudden rush of motivation about wanting to do the senior design project alone, like i imagined myself like Nagi or sth surpassing all of them, it's difficult to recreate the feeling on the spot, but then if just.hit me that that was just me being prideful, and then i felt a bit bad lol, but now i feeels it, I'm not gonna stop learning, this summer is gonna be, new skills summer? For me. Last summer was chillax summer xD, this summer is to get me.out of my comfort zone for the best, like what have I been doing, html css and js?? bASIC, i remember talking to the dude at the dhack and realizing how small my contributions have been, in terms of what i know, so let's expand that!! Doing hard stuff with simulations and math? Check ✔️, Doing react which I've been shying away from, check ✔️, learning no SQL and node and just databases in general, check ✔️, working with teams and with Ai technology, check ✔️, working with command line prompts and work with different operating systems, check ✔️. Listing it all off makes me sound like I'm doing a lot, but i know I'll have some free time here and there to just relax and take in all the info, i still need a definite plan and once j get the node js course, i think everything will be a go

    Entry: Had a pretty productive day today but tomorrow is going to be even more productive, setting up a new training program and having an scp call, omg 2 weeks left but not getting hopes up, call with Dr Hill and the Canton community connect, which speaking of which, went pretty well, also had a call with Ethan Ben and Andre and talked about role delegation stuff and it turned out pretty great tbh. ..Hmm, finished ibt gender, which was earlier in the morning and feels like so long ago, and did some coding in immersed, multiple screens is amazing!!!!..Hmm, planning on continuing my learning of react tomorrow, used some of it in Canton connect but I'm still a big big noob and just trying to understand and not necessarily memorize the syntax. Node js course still pretty expensive and was looking at a fire ship react course, I'm gonna have a lotta free time but at the same time, not really :*), we'll see after this week how it all goes. I'm boutya head to bed now tho, tomorrow starting the book for the month of may, the midnight circus ooo

    Entry: Almost forgot to journal xD, I've had a very very weird day, it's raining rn so it's pretty nice but it's not loud :(,  started the day normally, or i guess pretty normally, last night i finished lord of the flies, and decided to now do a book a month! Which is pretty nice to have measurable goals, then headed to campus, i fear writing this down but where else am I going to be able to have a brain dump, so here goes, Ethan was wearing sweatpants and not cargo pants, which was super weird lol,, but i kept staring at his butt 😂😭, omg anyone reading this, please don't flame me too much loll, especially you future Ara, anyways, yeah it wasn't like a creepy thing, well, i don't even know how to classify it, i just need to detox my brain, a big detox of my brain, a VRRY BIG detox of my brain before i step back out into society lol..Gonna start the book midnight circus, and got a 42 over 43 on the midterm which was pretty nice, hmm, yeah got home and watched some videos about natural language processing and found some templates to use for the Canton project, didn't do a coding club call today and I've lost a lot, a lot of momentum on the project to be honest but we have to keep it going, now i have a lot of stuff to focus on, i want to focus on react and node js and if the course price drops, I'm getting the course, it goes into mongodb but since it's one of the more.popular ones, i don't mind at all. ..Still doing the sandbox challenges and learned about the history tag and being able to use the ! command with the history index to run a peevious prompt. Then worked on the UDM reimbursement project and improved the sign up page. Also finished the basic implementation of ibt, now i just have to style up feedback, validate some stuff, maybe rename some types cause they are kinda confusing right now, and i should be able to apply the changes to all the other tests which hopefully wouldn't take long. Then off to IT and the others. Rn my priorities are all over the place, I'll text Dr Hill about maybe setting up a virtual meeting, added to reminders, adding that and the new seed Bridge would definitely eat time but i definitely will have enough time, i hope, react node Matlab ai stuff, it's gonna be a lot and I'm not sure which to focus on first, I've also been feeling like I'm missing something big, but I'll roll a wheel or something to choose which i want to focus on and then see what i incline to..Also spent a buncba time studying with immersed, it was so nice

    Entry: Just had two calls that could change the direction of my previous entry 😂, okay so let's start out with today, what did i do today, well woke up and it was raining, well it had been raining for a while so it was pretty nice, everyone went their ways and i did some sandbox challenges while working on ibt i believe, I'm not done with it and I'm trying to rewrite how i did it so it might take me, well it will take me much longer. Played echo and did a nice Les Mills workout, showered obvio, then yadda yadda 5 o clock came!!..Had the Canton project meeting with Dr bani taan! And i think it went pretty well, he didn't know i was 17 loll, i feel so so young, anyways we talked about the project, we are looking for templates and we have a week to get it all done. Anyways here comes the big league, after the call Jimmy, Jamal Dari, idk why i put his full name bu whatever, asked me to get Ina. Call with him and he showed me a project idea of his that looks really cool integrating NLP in learning and could really shape education and learning with Ai and not against AI, he was excited to find someone who was excited about coding, and i am too! He's working with some complex stuff with microservices and react, surprisingly i didn't feel overwhelmed, maybe I'm starting, well not really even now i don't feel overwhelmed, we talked through what he does and general chatting, he works with react and gave me a quick demo and i don't hate the syntax of react tbh xD, i think I'm gonna write Minim in react 👀👀👀👀. I was thinking of it before but why not just go for it, i have nothing to lose and being hard headed about learning it is going to get me nowhere, so it is decided hehe, add react to the list bebe, actually i still have db final tomorrow, i should really get on studying 😭, i did some studying here and there but nothing super comprehensive, we are gonna talk more about his project when the Canton project is finished, im super happy Dr bani taan considered me, and now I'm wondering how many opportunities I've missed, but i have no one else to thank but God, tbh i haven't been considering Him in all this all along but i really should ;*). Thank you God :D. ..Even if everything we are working on doesn't amount to much, it is good to keep expectations low and be realistic, but it is still good to create these connections and be able to learn real skills that will be helpful in the real world, which im here for!..Also did a play test with nyny!

    My mood Bored
    
    Entry: Today was sooooo boring, for the most part. Played some echo after a long while and got MVP twice, I'm watching some Matlab videos to see how helpful it would be in the future, doesn't seem like it would be :*), but at least it's something to do over the summer and it'll get me.into simulations and could get me into cool stuff, i wonder if i should do smol projects ,nah I'm just gonna go down a rabbit hole - i was referring to with web dev but still, gonna stick with minim, i finished the iat tests today and I'm still not 100 percent happy with the security, like there are for sure bugs i haven't spotted which is a bummer ;0;, but that's expected i guess, good thing ibt would be easier and i might even be able to get it done in one day, it's like a zoomed in version of an iat with just one test, so one file needed, and i should be able to store the data like normal, shouldn't take more than 3 days. ..Gonna finish it by the end of the month. ..Hmm, also Dr bani taan contacted me about join an app dev team! It's gonna be fun, idk anyone else on the team but I'm happy he thought of me :D, we are going to have a call at 5pm tomorrow and i guess I'll meet everyone thenz dangit i also wanna do some Google earth engine stuff :*), okay so here are the things that i am interested in ..- Earth engine .- AI.- Three js and 3d animations .- Backend technologies and database .- Matlab - goes with Ai and simulation stuff a bit cause I've also been watching a lot of code bullet.- Sandbox challenges ( Linux commands, navigating through command line etc )..That's all I can remember for now, maybe add mobile development in there as well, i still have some ideas. Then here's what Im most likely going to be working on over the summer ..- Matlab with Dr Hill.- Rewriting C.A.T.- Minim.- - Under minim, going to work with mongodb to learn more about no SQL databases.- - Also under this, going to get the node js with mongo course, made by Jonas so it should be pretty good! 42 hours as well, 15 to 30 mins a day should be able to get a good quantity of it done over the summer, gonna have to create a routine out of it.- Sandbox challenges ..Apart from 3d animations and doing my own stuff with AI, like creating my own models, which i guess now is pretty unnecessary, i think it would be good to be able to use the tools like gpt in every day scenarios and so on...Just got a big urge to deploy my interviewAI app but depending on others is a drag and i can't finish the process myself eugh. I do want to do some coding every day or at least most days of the break! Now I'm feeling more motivated than bored, but dude I'm telling you, sometimes I don't like when i suddenly have sth to do, but being bored can be just as worse..New Simpsons episode had some good moments too xD..Ok why not create a plan now ..SUMMER PLAN ✨ ✨.- Start with continuation of rewriting children association tests, should be finished in 3 to 4 weeks. Took me about a month to finish the beginning, setting the store and routes and tech up, and then finish IAT touchscreen and keyboard, so the rest should be able to fall into place well ..- Start with a few sandbox tutorial videos a day, change accordingly ..- Start summer research with Dr Hill and learning about Matlab, this will probably take up the most part of my day ..- While all these is going on, start with the backend course and learn bit by bit about backend technologies, so when I've settled down with a good knowledge, i can start working on things like authentication etc etc and finish Minim or get to a good point before the end of the summer...Very tentative plan but i can start today, gonna buy the course if the price is low, start the day off with some sandbox tutorial videos , i spend too much time lazing around in the morning and j think it sets a precedent for the day, so no more of that, gonna get on my laptop, then it's go go go, finish some ibt tests tomorrow, even just one will be fine as it'll mostly be setting up the playing field, and then get on the call with Dr bani taan ,and do more research with Dr Hill

    Entry: omg had the most random dream, first it all started in class with Dr mina teaching us something i think the final grades were due and she was making us read stuff for our grade and Lukas and the other dude were trying to get better scores, then i went to a room to get tape? and saw Josephine dressed up and met a new staff type person, omg it felt so real, then before that actually Dr mina was telling us how she got married and showed us pictures and oriekaose was there, then for some reason we were in Dan's area trying to do something i can't remember, with the mansions all around and i found myself walking home with Ethan, there was so much bird poop and worms on the floor xD we were trying to avoid them, then we got to where i live, but before that, we were also in a spaceship?? but yeah we got to where i live and i tried to sneak in so Ben wouldn't see and then someone entered, so i crsmmed myself into an office and while i was hiding, some device started playing music loll, then the dream ended. I'm not doing this dream justice at all

    Entry: Got a nice scare today, Spotify had an update and i couldn't find Holmes account, luckily found it!! Twas weird but crisis averted, you know you're pretty blessed by God when the crisis is not finding a YouTuber. Did a deload workout, 185 felt heavy for some reason, then did a lower weight, then 185 felt normal again, then i met Ben when he was working out and did a 20 min walk while watching family guy, also worked on the figma of the note taking app while watching South Park which was hilarious as always ..SHELLLYY..Mobile app class was fun, and i had a talk about Ben about you know who, and it was kind of refreshing to hear that i haven't been thinking in an emotional bubble i guess and i haven't been the only one noticing stuff, but i still didn't feel great about talking about someone i know behind their back, don't wanna be one of those people..Got a 94/70 on linear algebra test 😭, tears of joy, crushed the class, new challenge on the way 😭, what else what else. I'm feeling a bit chunky again :*), for SCP Vanita asked about wanting to do a video type thing, but I don't want to, and i have to learn how to say no, or at least ignore my issues till they go away 😭😂..Worked a bunch on the UDM app tho, which was nice, pretty decent day, it rained a lot and had a discussion with Ben about where we were from and things we faced, pretty nice discussion, Also learned that Caleb used to have anger issues, more weird subjects i don't know why I'm adding 😂

OopDay in the life dream..I added that after i woke up from a dream loll, it was a dream that felt like a simulation of my day to day life, it was a pretty nice dream and made me feel like i should start logging my dreams again...I just finished darling in the fraanx? and it was kinda weird, the ending that is, technically the last like 5 episodes, but all in all i really enjoyed it, had the demo call with Dr mina as well which went swimmingly, i was preoccupied and still a little.bit so about the idea of role rotations and especially task hoarding, idk why that got to me a lot ;-;, but it did :(. Oop. Seems like Dr mina found an error  ;0;..Gonna push that outta my mind for now. Finished linear algebra test but gonna submit it early mañana,played some beat saber today. Hmm what else, dad made hamburger meat. Random detail i feel like i should mention

    My mood Motivated
    
    Entry: In a completely different mood from yesterday, i feel super motivated! Super might be an overstatement, but i feel pretty darn motivated. Was able to deploy the UDM app with the help of pigeons tools - planet scale and render, even though I did wanna use vercel xD, it was a struggle, but i did it, and it made me realize just how much i don't know about software dev, like I'm clueless 😭😭, at first i got to a good place with front end dev, and i know that there are still a lot of things i don't know in that respect either, i was having issues showing sorted data just a few days back 😭 - future me and present me, stop going through your head as to how you made it work, you did it once, you'll be able to do it avain, i just thought of a different approach to doing it smh, anyways, there is so much stuff that i don't know 😭😭, and I've been watching bacend dev videos about the technologies and roadmaps and I've been looking into different courses and wow yeah, the thing I've repeated like 3 times now lol, but still i guess, i know it means that i still have a long way to go, and idk i kinda feel a bit Stoopid trying to keep up with skills like these just to have ai snatch it all away, but dood wuteva 😭, that's my goal for the summer, backend technologies!!! Some front end new ones as well, like getting comfy with SSR and payment stuff, gonna take a course plus do sandbox challenges to get better at Linux course. ..It's gonna be my summer darkside challenge loll, and concerning fitness, gonna get calisthenicsy and try to get good at some of them advanced movements, ofc I'm moving too fast ;-;, 4 months is not gonna be enough time to get super good at backend of course, but it's still gonna make me.feel.a bit happier about understanding more about things work and defogging the black box, it'll be a challenge like any other, and by Gods grace I've come out of them unscathed, and never gotten myself into a pickle i can't dill my way out of :*). ..Oh, forgetting one big part of the day, we went shopping! Walked a lot, my back hurts and there was an anime store with cool anime art. Hmm what else what else, did a bit of work on CAT rewrite and finished one other test, my progress and motivation has slowed a lot recently but ik it'll pick back up once i pick it back up, did some Lin alg homework too which was grrrreat, tomorrow, I'm still debating on whether to go to campus or not :*), i think I'll stay home, it would be much nicer and i wouldn't have to see people. And VR! And i can work on finishing all the tests for iat keyboard, then starting on the touchscreen ones trying to use the same format...This is becoming a long ish entry lol, had like a 4 hour call with Ben ! Trying to get his firebase stuff to work, wow his app is confusing and helping him or trying to help him hurt my brain ;*). Over the summer I'll make my journey to learn more about backend more project based, maybe I'll use react too 👀👀, nahh, well, we'll see, we'll see.  Having a lil bit of react knowledge never hurt anyone. Anyways gonna go bed now, cyaa

    Entry: I am boreddddddddddddd, and dude i had a moment of big terror, well terror isn't a good word to describe it, but my mum asked when we'd be vacating etc etc and if i would now be a junior, and ofc yeah i am, but it still made me feel like time was moving too fast and soon I'll be old and not have enough time, which is kinda stupid cause anything could.hapoen at any time(⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠-̩̩̩⁠), random emoticon by mistake but it works. ..And i guess that serves to show that lately I've been more focused on things of the earth, haven't even kept.up on my psalms ugh, gonna read one now. I really did panic about it tho, like i was losing out of time, and the fact that i spent the majority of the day being super bored, like the boredom where i don't want to do anything productive but i also don't feel like being unproductive but there's nothing pressing to do, i don't like that feeling, i did work a bit on the reimbursement project, nothing on CAT rewrite, i should clear the data loll,..Oh and today's earth day? That's cool i suppose. It rained a twensy bit and i started Lin alg test even though entiendo nada de nada. Ugh idk why i got so worked up about growing older. Id like to think of reasons why growing older isn't a bad thing, ofc it's not even anything i can control so it's Stoopid to worry about it, and i couldn't be bothered to start listing reasons why it'll be a good thing for me. ..Anyrays, gonna go play sky now. I'm debating going to campjs on Monday and trying out for a PR on bench, like a 1rm, maybe go for 275? Who knows, quien sabe..Oh and i started darling in the franxxx, and this happened a while ago but i was watching some Betty en NY clips and i got so worked up and squealy over it even now 😂, its amazing

Beta had a biggg update with a lotta new stuff and I'm super excited ee, i saw the new area and got pumped about it xD. Also played a little with nyny! ..Went to school a bit late, didn't do much, i guess now I'm the vice president of the African Caribbean club along with oriekaose, or i guess co president 🤷‍♂️. Tomorrow gonna do some work on it i suppose. Hmm what else what else. Found out Ethan's crush was a girl named Selina Hakim 🤣🤣, it was hilarious xD. We recorded the video too. ..I haven't worked on the CAT rewrite in quite a while, focusing on db project stuff for now, tomorrow gonna work on generating the data and putting it in the table, then life will be good...Don't have all that much to say apart from all that

    Entry: Now feeling meh :*), got into a quasi argument with Ben about the project, he was trashing on all the stuff we haven't completed yet, but i stepped away, maybe not early enough, but still, and tried to reevaluate everything and think of things objectively and tried not to worry too much about it, watched  a buncba South Park episodes but finished presentation for mobile app ..Last linear alg class of the semester as well!! We made it 😭. The African Caribbean meeting is tomorrow ;-;, and omg oh i already said it before but still, 315 for 3!!! 315!!!!! All that's left is 315 on bench xD, i wonder what other exercises I've been slacking on and getting too comfy in. Super happy with this one!..Also sky's day of nature started today, all the good cosmetics are in the pass 😭, but i already have beta so I'm stopping myself from buying it, gotta be smart with my spending. ..Also had a seed meeting today too. Okay so, plan for tomorrow, finish pdf generator!! Which, sheesh is not gonna be difficult one bit, but i can work top down if i have to ;0;. Step by step mihijito, also destress fest, didn't go, Nolan canceled class:*). So i left campus early. now I'm feeling a bit tired ..Imma watch my PR video again loll. Well next week is gonna be a deload week :*), goodbye gains for now, welcome cardio gains. Well i wanna work on calishetics, gonna find a good 3 day program where i can still do Les Mills 2 days a week! This time I'm gonna do things right. ..I don't have much to add now tho, there was a plane flying around advertising weed cause it's 4 20 lolll, it was super weird. Apparently we have a paper final for mobile app dev, que estúpido, no quiero 😭😭, it means that I'll have to study, don't even know what that means, hopefully he changes his mind

See how it feels ya dig, i think I'll go for it and record it!!!i might be my last leg session before a deload. ..Apart from that, didn't do much today, twas a one class type day, and all we did was not even work on our project , Dr mina came to us after class to discuss it and give us feedback..Also now discord has a new UI!! Well it's in beta and stuff, but it's still cool, wasn't able to get any reading done today, was trying to finish the edit reimbursement part of the project and at least now it works, for now ಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ, we'll see..This'll be another quite short journal tho, also had a catch up call with Dan to talk about next steps

Which was pretty cool, he was also there as well, saw Dr heather hill as well, and one of the presenters, Suzanne something talked about giving to the library, and dooood, future me if you can give, give to the library! Make your happy place an even happier place xD...Then squeezed Ina. Nice quick, super quick workout, would've made some good gains if i didn't have to rush, but it was still nice, my elbows felt amazing!! Like normally my right elbow would feel weak, but taking a step back from training did it wonders!..Also sky's new season just started and it's super chill and beautiful

    Entry: Liistening to caught on fire now 😁, weird emoji suggestion lol, but the song still takese way back, and i hope I take it forward too, watched a bunch a psyche and Oshi no ko, that movie was sad 😭🥹🥹, i know they're animated characters and all but it was still very sad. Moreso , YAC meeting went really well, it's so nice having an internet connection, i have to catch up with Dan later in the week ..Dood i feel like sharing this random info but in the meeting, we were talking about who was going to dj for us, and Jordan knew someone and sent him Vanessa's number, and the dude called her immediately!! Like it was kinda pretty funny, but i wouldn't have been able to do sth like that, ik I'm overanalyzing the situation but I'd take my sweet time before reaching out, the dude wasn't scared to call and i am scared of receiving calls - from the slaughter house dude who wants the website. And they also know their value! And it 100 percent seems like i don't, which is pretty annoying, not really, but pretty sad :(. I think I'll start heading to bed though ..It didn't rain yesterday, but the smell still makes me so happy, i wonder what my future will be like, i don't want it to be boring, but i don't want it to be too exciting or overstimulating or stressful. Alas, i know  how useless needless future planning can be, cough cough when i was planning where to live as a wildlife biologist, it feels like such a long time ago..On a smaller scale, I'll try to see how productive ill be tomorrow, gonna try to get a lot of work done., Maybe in the CAT rewrite!..Also went shopping and some random dude asked if we worked out 😂. Second compliment today and i still feel like I'm pretty small, could be just some fed up body dysmorphia, i tells you i still feel very much fat, but maybe i just need a good haircut

    Entry: Feeling pretty good, In an Uber headed home after the meeting and it was fun! Laughed a lot and talked about ai loll, not overthinking things is pretty nice, gonna take the same mindset to the donors recipient meeting on Monday, don't overthink or overstress about what's coming, just do it..Also my Uber complimented my frame and asked me if I played football xD

    Entry: Smells like rain, and dudeeeee, i feel so much happier 😅, it's weird, I'm watching the Simpsons rn, modern Simpsons, it still has some good jokes. Didn't go on campus today, but also didn't really workout, which was a bummer, i haven't worked on CAT rewrite in a while, well, like in 2 days, welp, no matters, was working and made good progress on database proj...To the one thing that made me ehhhh, meeting with SCP tomorrow ,already told my mum and worked on not overthinking everything about what i was gonna say, and it worked pretty well i suppose, im gonna be going to Aldi shopping with her tomorrow as well, we'll see how it goes. I wanna read now tho, this is perfect reading weather!..I'll go read now tho!

    Entry: At first i was gonna say relaxed, but i don't think if encompasses all the emotios i felt today, first happiness cause i was able to stay home ,i really don't wanna go on campus tomorrow, now my honeymoon phase has passed lol, then worry and stress about handling stripe payments and i know.now that ill get through it and that a good night sleep will calm me down, I've already calmed down quite a bit tho, they have test api endpoints which are pretty cool so i can already work on it without having to connect their business stuff to it and so on. I'd have to set up a node server but it just means more backend practice which is pretty cool cause this project has already essentially given me that ..Then i worked on the contact experience section of the IAT rewrite, i should be able to finish the IAT feedback by tomorrow to be honest, that'd make like 1 whole week to rewrite the IAT test , even though the actual thing at first took me, a long long time, even when i wanted to refactor and change from having different pages xD. Good times, i can still look back at my code loll. I remember feeling overwhelmed then about the project, i still do right now to be honest, but it doesn't mean that i wouldn't be able to get through it, with God by my side at least, speaking of which, filled out the cru form thingy, hmm, linear algebra test was graded and i got a 74!! Like waaaa. That was pretty impressive and made me hapi, at first i thought she was gonna send me an email being like i cheated cause she didn't grade mine as soon as quickly as she graded Andres. Everything turned out just alright tho. ..So i was able to work on the adding reimbursement styling, gonna work on the functionality tomorrow! Dr mina is gonna be super shocked when she sees how far we've gone loll, also reaxhed 1300 entries today! Omg is that there years? Well it's entries not days, but it's still a lot, geez! 1300 of me writing to myself and a lot about me has changed and a lot hasn't :(, at least now i miss savvy less lol, time heals all wound ( imagine in sarcastic up down voice ). Hmm what else what else . I also didn't eat a lot today, and the weather was very hot 😭, 25c, I'm wearing shorts!! Por dios, apart from the freelanxe offer, which my parents said i should charge a lot lol,.I'm thinking 400 dollars and we'll see how it goes..Right now ignore me, I'm imagining a conversation in my head with the scholarship donor about bobs burgers for some reason loll, i guess I'm still psychologically preparing for it, but before i. Know it, this semester is going to be over. Also i prolly should start looking into skincare products

    My mood Meh
    
    Entry: I'm finding it harder to differentiate between stresses and new experiences if that makes sense. So essentially my dad just called saying that the dude at his workplace wants a website and he's gonna call me to talk about it, and i feel, i don't even know how I feel, like i mean i want to do freelance stuff, and this is the perfect AAA HWA XLING MW NOW. aHHH HE JIST CALLED AS I WAS WRITING LOL, HES gonna be doing payment stuff, like online where people can order stuff omg 😂😭. ..I'm thinking of doing per hour work, omg this is technically my first, or second real gig aaaa, this is what I want to be doing so why not start now 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭, now I'm more excited, we are going to be doing payment stuff, so paying online, which i haven't done before eeee 😂, definitely gonna be using stripe for that and even though I'm not 100 percent sure of how to make it work, i know i can do it, and i always have sunny Vue to help and Dan as well :D, the only bummer might be that I'd have to postpone the rewrite of CAT again, I'm working on it right now, but we'll see, i can make it work, definitely!! ..Except edit, I'mooking at stripes documentation and it doesn't look super difficult but it looks like it's gonna cause some issues cause i have to use the clients business information as part of stripes built in features etc etc.  Or just as easily i could.use webflow again lolll, nah I'd rather not gonna make this a real project, my mum said 300 dollars is the least so i think I'll ask for 450 dollars loll, and then we will see how it goes, it's new technology but I've been putting off learning how to use stripe for a long long long long time, and Dan's there to help me since it seems like he has used it before, we'll see 😭. I will figure out a way to make it work,..Stripe will be probably the biggest challenge,  but it has really good documentation, and if checkout doesn't work, i can always use the one time.payment link! I jus have to study the documentation a lot

    Entry: Another happy ish day, i didn't get the opportunity to read, was on a call with Ben and Ethan getting some work done on the reimbursement app and we've made a lotta.progress! Which is always pretty cool, I'm liking node a latte. I kept feeling like i was forgetting something, i was walking to the fitness center and a dog came up to me and it was so cute lol. Did deadlifts!! 315 for 6, then for 4, which is pretty nice and I'm sure i could've gotten 2 more reps but it would've EXHAUSTED ME, but i have gotten much much stronger volume wise, well not much much, but enough to be noticeable and make me happy, still feeling very fat tho 😭..I haven't been playing sky a lot :(, but i guess it's fine , we've had our fun and I'll keep exploring the beta! And playing Eden hehe. ..What am I thinking hmmm, i met my mentor! C j morrell and it was pretty nice i suppose, it was after mobile app dev,which we did nothing in. Prof Nolan asked what i was doing for summer and told him research, apparently Matlab is still pretty popular so learning it over the summer is pretty nice, and I'm gonna be working on my backend definitely over the summer. Also been talking to Jared more which is pretty nice, it'd be hilarious if i was still connected to the discord call and sharing my screen xD. Hello Ben and Ethan 👀. ..I'm not going to campus tomorrow, I'll do a boxing workout, my heart needs the cardio definitely, and it's gonna be more fun than spending hours y horas on campus. Also we now have normal tasting liver!!! I'm so happy about that xD. I might also start needing to clean out my ears. Also linear algebra test I'm sure i messed up on, we will see we vill see. ..Tomorrow, i don't have much to do to be honest, new.ohysics homework beugh, but apart from that, i can focus on oee rewrite, now I'm even getting overwhelmed about the rewrite 😂😭, I'll get over it, I'm just being dum about it, i wrote the code and test the code regularly so I'll be fine 😭

    Entry: Today was a lazy esque chill day, went on campus at like 11 cuz only class online yada yada, and i was feeling very, very self conscious, felt super fat essentially 😭, it wasn't a good feeling, especially when talking to other people and having the voice in the back of my head constantly bugging me ;-;, but i pulled through, worked out and even though no prs, i felt decently strong and was happy with my form, especially cause i have to be nice to my right elbow ;*;, dang echo...Continued reading lord of the flies and dedicated more time to reading instead of close to bedtime, i could totally see it as a studio ghibli movie. ..Also played tennis with Ethan and John, it was pretty fun! Linear algebra is out and i am immensely confused and have no idea what I'm doing 😭😭, two weeks left, two flipping weeks left. also fixed the bug in the reimbursement project and stored foapa number on front end so that i can get foapa number etc etc. Front end still isn't done, I'm finding it hard to juggle that and the other projects but i think like i said before, im gonna put the oee rewrite on the back burner for now, najat and Dr qian haven't responded so i have a breather, except i got an email about the donor thing and i so don't wanna go, we'll see tho, I've survived through worse. I say this like seeing my donor is a bad thing or sth, which is Stoopid, but whatever. ..I'm also making a more conscious effort to eat less, much much less. And healthier as well, well, relatively, them plantains are goood. But i fry them in oil, tons of extra cals. No I'm not gonna develop a bad relationship with food 😭, i hope, but now no more.ice cream at tdr, just plain old good food, and tea! Joe Delaney just released a video talking about him trying to get better now and do everything optimally, even though I'm far far from that, i can still try my best to get rid of some extra pounds...I'm feeling pretty tired rn, gonna head to bed, also watched the last Futurama movie which wasn't as good as the others ;*) ..I also had an interesting dream i can't remember 😭, time to start dream. Journaling again?

    Entry: Happy Easter!! Woke up to an empty house, mum had to cover someone's shift so it was pretty nice to be home alone, relatively. Anyways started off the day with some code and i was right! From yesterday i said i should be able to be done with most of the logic, and i was :D, which is pretty nice 🙂, that's a weird emoji, but i kinda like it, not the weird discord one. Anyways I spent a biggg chunk of today coding, but i also did physics quiz, getting started on assgn 4 tomorrow, and did a lil bit of the reimbursement project as well. ..Oriekaose finishd the chess club ad, and it is amazing and memeable and hilarious 😂. Thinking of it just made me laugh out loud  😂, omg i have to send the link here- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LeZHDhkrtDn_ZjxPOgDVtbQJaWaq3vfk/view?usp=sharing there we go, future me can go watch it and laugh if you need to 😂, it's amazing. Probably the highlight of the day, i also played against a candidate master in chess.clm and lost miserably, I'm banging my head on the wall repeatedly LOL ,AAHH I COULD'VE,prolly not, but could've won it 😂😂, dood in 9 moves loll, i miss being able to write in English and fully express my thoughts!! Also gonna start this new book called the land or lord of the flies, like the studio ghibli movie. Also played echo a bunch! And gods of gravity, watched a bunch a YouTube video and essentially a full munecat vid, yesterday idk if i said but we had guests over! And i finally had the guts to admit that the liver tastes weird and omg she knew all along as well cause the liver was old, which is pretty weird, but still!! Alright what else happened today, Ben got his food api thing working apparently, and idk, I'd like to say I'm fully happy for him, but you know me, and i know me, so I'm not gonna lie to myself, but i am gonna say that i recovered pretty quickly and i mean, I'll celebrate with him anytime. I told them i got a new.phone number as well , and i still have the knot in my back..And no classes tomorrow!!! Wohoo,why? Cause Dr mina is sick :(, I'm still gonna go on campus tho and lift some heavy weights aaa. I think I'll update my mood, i watched another Futurama movie and spent a good chunk of the day relaxing, if not for rewriting the app, i would've essentially done nothing today!! But i like that I'm learning a lot while refactoring the code, especially in typescript and now in node js, I'm gonna try sth called transactions tomorrow to try to fix the code issues we facing and see how it goes. I kinda like node a lot..I also went to Eden and helped a moth! Maybe that's my new sky role loll

    Entry: Why not okay, I'd want to say happy ish, but today has been pretty great, went to the coding teachers house and we got sims!!! Now i have a number, it's pretty exciting which is kinda weird xD, but can't argue with it eh, what works works. I have a know in my back and it's pretty annoying..but apart from.that, today was pretty good ..Yesterday was Hansel's birthday! Totally forgot :*), I'm jumping all over the place but we had Mexican food and i got tacos with barbacoa, the beef and it was pretty good with the sauce ,but by itself, mehh. Then we set up the oee stuff, i worked on some of the dashboard for the rebusement project, ans in yet another side note, I'm taking a side break from writing here in Spanish, just for now and to be able to connect and convey my thoughts and feelings better. ..Also tomorrow is Easter!! And i made some good progress in setting up the CAT stuff, it's moving much faster since i decided it's easier to use the logic of the previous one, it works, it's a bit convoluted and I'm trying to change the syntax from this based to xxxx.value based, so it changes the main state directly, i just have to be careful, I'm getting slacky with ensuring that the code is clean, and i guess it is hard to make clean code in some scenarios, but I'll still try my best not to make it a disaster to maintain like the other code base ;-;, i believe i should be able to implement everything by tomorrow, and im also gonna get started on the prof homework tomorrow ;-;, Ben says it's long, but then again, it's Ben, we'll see how it goes. ..I'm finally free from the shackles of android studio development !! Till maybe later, i have to watch Godfrey's lecture as well. ..Oh we had guests over as well! Okay now I'm done with this very very messy and disorganized entry

    Entry: Hay nuevoas funciones en daylio! Que interesante, I'm sleeping later than usual today :(, the reimbursement project has essentially being go go go but we are making good progress i think, I'm still learning more about node and i was focused on figuring out how to handle errors, and i did! I learned how to handle the errors that is. ..Hmm today was a long, long day of coding, first woke up to a nice no school start, parents went to work and i scrolled through reddit for a while, then i started on the redo of the cat project, i got finished with the explicit attitudes part and changed how i was.using pinia, which I'm still not fully comfortable with, but it's the dev life and im just slowly getting used to being like, idk why this works, it works, it's just gonna be the new normal and nothing to it, like I've been trying to tell myself, learn organically. Anyways tomorrow I'm gonna do the prog assignment, i got finished with my.physics assignment after and was able to get all the changes to the oat site done!!!!! 🎊 Also found a bug that got me super worried but it was fixed :),ez win. Was just one line as well loll ..But i even skipped a part, this morning, i had a dream where i was on a date with this girl, it felt super real, the emotions and wanting to be with her, it stayed with me after but now the feeling is gone loll. It was still a really nice dream. ..So after doing therevised CAT, the CAT, then got to work on the reimbursement project, set up SQL and all that jazz, then went over to the OEE project and made some good progress there, then back to the reimbursement project with Ben and Ethan. Also we going to coding teachers house tomorrow woohoo. Also watched two Futurama movies, the second one was really good xD, had a lotta great jokes, watched the simpsons as well. It was a super coding oriented day, but i still relaxed and played echo ..I really should switch up the emotions list, I'm gonna start setting more.boundaries and sleeping much earlier, I'm not a fan of sleeping too late. Tomorrow I'll start with finishing the sign up page functionality, I'm already really close and it routes to the dashboard, then i can start styling the page up which should take me a nice chunk of time, but I'll get it done

    Entry: We went to the zoo today! And today Godfrey is not in class, so I had lunch with Andre and Josephine. The zoo was interesting, I had a good time and it reminds me of when I came here in 9th grade. I took a lot of pictures! I'm going to upload them here. ..What's more, I have to continue my physics homework ;-;. But I was able to configure express js, it wasn't very difficult, but I need to practice and use it more to feel more comfortable with the technology. At least, as I told pigeon, backend is not a black box anymore, it's a grey box now, the color has changed, but now it's more transparent, I can understand more about how it works and how it communicates with the front end but there are many many many things that I don't know how to do, but I'm learning! Every day!!...Oh and i had a great workout as well, even thought i was superrrr sweaty, my legs were so shaky when i was doing lunges 😭😭

    Entry: Hi i'm not feeling "happy" but i'm okay i'm fine, i forgot my computer charger at home so i spent the whole day on my phone 😭 it wasn't horrible but i couldn't work or finish my physics homework like i wanted to, i guess i can do that tomorrow. ..Dr qian sent me a reply and i'm glad he already made the changes and now i just need to ask him a few things. I also joined a call with ben and ethan and we finished the assignment and are going to start the actual project >:), we already have our homework done and i have to setup express js, it's going to be really interesting;-;..Hmmm, since i couldn't use my computer, i picked a random spanish book from the library and i read it but i was getting super sleepy and i didn't understand a lot of the spanish vocabulary but it felt pretty nice just to relax for a while. I had theost awkward run in with aldo, alto? I met him in tdr and he joined my table, and all I wanted to do was watch the Simpsons while it was raining, and I did exactly that 😂, I tried not to ignore him completely not to be rude, but I can never look at him straight in the eye and hold a conversation with him so I just decided it wasn't worth it, and got some good food in my belly. We got the new mattress today as well and it's pretty soft ..When I got back my computer, I had to answer a buncha emails ;-;, RSVP'd for the mentor event next week Tuesday and the donor event ugh the donor, my donor is gonna be there which I guess is pretty cool? I wonder what they're like, and if they are going to be grilling me loll, I doubt it, but who knows, I don't know what the format of the event is going to be and I don't want to have to interact with them one on one but the more I think about things, the more unwilling I am to do them is apparent, and I usually always feel like this before doing something new or uncomfortable, but I just need to zip it, shut it, suck it up and get it over with, I have survived worse, and I get to dress up all fancy! Well bUsIneSS cAsUaL, we haven't gotten any new people on the server which is super weird and annoying and surprising, but I guess I'm fine with who we have right now...My reading habit is slowly fading away and I wanna focus away from reading fantasy cause now I'm already used to being able to watch fantasy, and instead reading about things like philosophers and their writings and thought processes etc etc,...I think that's all for today, tomorrow no mobile app dev Woop Woop so I'm gonna start the day with physics, work on getting at least 10 questions in, then work on the CAT refactoring, once I've finished one IAT, I'll be sailing through the others!..Also i am still somehow thinking of why people call arms guns loll, it's just sinking in, and even better yet no class Friday suckerssss

    Entry: Had a super super nice workout, talked to vex, he was angry about having to pay a buncha money and we just talked and now he happy, deadlifts felt nice and smooth, gonna move to 300 pounds to 315 pounds next week, elbow still hurts and pullups made it hurt a bit more, and my shoulders looked super big in the clothe i was wearing which is super weird, I've also been trying not to place too much stock in how i look or looking good, and some dude o thought was obnoxious complemented me on my deadlift form lol, now I'm listening to Duolingo podcasts which are super nice, qnd headed to library to find some work to do, i don't have a lot, just like physics homework, Lin alg homework and that's it, i should do linear first ..Anyways I'm walking and typing so I'll see you later

Well, that's not true, I watched a lot of Simpsons episodes, like trees, and I started psych and the episode lasted an hour! And I started it and finished it. ..It's really late now, and I want to sleep because I spent many hours with Ben and Ethan creating and configuring the project and the website design. Andre is sick, I don't know what he has and I hope he's okay, the new mattress has arrived! So there is more space now!! Much much better, it also rained today and there was loud thunder. Now I'm going to sleep!!

I got some work done with physics and wanted to continue linear algebra but i don't like my computer much, it's slow when it's not plugged in, it gets too hot and it's battery is whack, not a good experience ;-;, but it has a great screen and can handle A LOT, so I'm just being bratty :*), it's a great laptop for what i need it to do

I always survive, and I always think why do I care, I guess that's life, there was also an african club meeting etc etc, there weren't many people there..And lately the birds have come back, and I like watching them and listening to them and seeing their weird behaviors lol

I can't upload my app to the play store BECAUSE I have to be 18 or over 18 years old, and I have to verify my identity with a passport, how dumb, so Ben is going to upload it for me. ..Tomorrow is the chess club tournament, it's very likely that many people won't come, but that's okay and nothing happens, after tomorrow, I won't have to think about it. And I have to tell my mother that I'm going to school on the weekend, I always have these worries, you know, you know, unfortunately. ..I hate these cramps, and I started Elena knows and it's the perfect Spanish level for me

Or wanting to feel needed, or like bragging about stuff you haven't even gotten or something that was handed to you!! Like what!!..Okay i think I've let out enough brain juices, and ugh the chess club, i miss my free time on Thursdays and it feels like more of a chore than anything, any passion behind it is now kinda long gone and chess isn't ruined for me, but it's less fun you know, the attendance has drpped and the charity tournament might end up being a dud..Anyways I'm done and I'll step off my soapbox xd,thanks for coming to ma tedtalk, at least my brain is calmer now, i think, or more riled up, I'll sleep good that's for sure. There's nothing else pressing to me rn, I'm looking forward to the summer break and a break away from other people, even though idk, i can't tell whether i like being surrounded by them or not. Only specific people in specific situations then I'm fine, i love lunch by myself, and cooking and watching anime at home loll, but yeah imma do my Duolingo and read a psalm, which i now wanna punch myself again cause of ykw2

And I’m trying to change the UI of InterviewAI, but there’s another thing that worries me, my mother took pictures of me, but in the pictures, I looked really fat 😭😭, I know it has the filters etc etc, but still, now I’m thinking about whether I want to start a cut, or if I want to keep eating a lot – I prefer this option because it will mean I can lift more weights etc etc, I’ll probably choose the second option, but summer is coming and it will mean I won’t be able to lift weights and I’ll have to do cardio,n

    Entry: I'm journaling so early cause I just had a great dream and everything is coming back to me, it was at udm, omg a random part of it was that Ms Vanita from SCP was there and telling us that we wouldn't get paid if we didn't finish our milestones and i did mine but forgot to turn it in, but i was at udm then saw adeniyi from vicsum and i wasn't super surprised but i was like hey and we were walking and walking till we reached the side of chemistry where Noah and some girl were arguing about some thing, it was a big thing with pizza and flyers loll, but then there was this vr place, so i climbed up and saw Ben, theni turned around and saw osazee and i was so surprised and oyinda and Michael were there as well but they were Dorming, but i got so happy to see their faces and thought that they were lucky to be able to spend time with each other in the dorms, then something happened and vr controllers got brunken and we couldn't find either Ben or Michael but everything eventually worked out fine, i don't have snooz on the phone yet but i really want it loll, imma add it today and once I finish with interviewAI, i also had the thought of adding a drawing feature to the app and making it more like daylio, where i see a list of all my entries and can add some on the bottom, and then they can also add audio recordings etc etc, for navigatour, they'd be able to save their locations and bring it back up anytime, maybe tweak read it a bit more and then make gymtroverts UI a bit better, also my ear is doing that full thing less

I can't explain it, it's like when you want to pop your ear but you can't, yes it is, it's a little frustrating and kinda scary but I don't want to think about it, my mom wants to buy a new bed, double deck, it will be very interesting to see that. ..I spent a lot of the day thinking that I forgot something, but I guess not, I played echo vr and another new strategy game and I like it! I also got three months of YouTube premium for free, how exciting, it's pretty useful, I played sky for a bit and had a good workout, and I saw a falcon, now I'm going to sleep, good night

My phone case came today, so tomorrow i will take my phone with me to school. hmm, i feel like that's it, ben is still working on his app and he was showing me his progress and in the back of my mind, i was thinking that i should think about things beyond and not bother with banal things, it helped me, and i hope i can continue wishing the best for my friends, now i read and sleep, ..I played sky with nyny Sean Sarah and Dave, it's been a long time since i have played with them. Or we also have a physics test tomorrow ;-;.

    Entry: I think you've already noticed but I have my new phone!!!! The pixel, it's very fancy, like when I got my new computer, and I'm programming all the little things - setting up - but when I'm done, I'll tell you all about my past days, yesterday I ended up like water for chocolate, it was very... interesting, but I'll talk to you later, now I want to eat because I'm very hungry, I also love this keyboard, it's very tactile..Come on, edit, I told you I was going to update you, it's been a very interesting, weird, irregular few days xD, okay I'm going to start with the day where my last phone was destroyed, or I destroyed it 👀, I went to the university to present my project, and you know I was very worried, but it turned out very good, I presented my Android studio projects, I also presented the Java projects, and there was a guy there - he works at criteo - and he uses react to create an app, it's very interesting, and I think now I have to start thinking about my project for myself sir...But that day, something else happened!! Dr bani taan gave me a new phone!!!, A Samsung something, and I have it in my backpack, it reminds me of the phone Daniel bought me xD , but now my standards have risen so I knew that if I wanted to buy a new phone, I had to run away from that phone, and I'm still running away from it 😭, in my backpack, I don't know where to put it aaa, I can't throw it away, because I don't know if de bani will want to use it, but also I don't need it, maybe I'll give it to Ethan or André or something, I'll find something, but I need to think about that something very soon. ..Ehh i love this phone sometimes it gets hot but it cools down really fast. ..The day after i broke my phone well i told my mom and she wanted me to try and rescue it but hopefully the battery swelled up and i can't use it so my dad gave me his old phone the s8 and i didn't want to do much with the phone so i just downloaded spotify brave and jefir to track my workouts, ..And next week there's going to be a chess contest that cru the chess club and the music club planned i hope it's a success and if not well nevermind the world isn't going to fall down speaking of which after a week its cru i need to read the psalms i realized my faith well my motivation to continue in my faith had gone down and now i'm trying to grow it back god help me. And now it's raining, I don't have the constant stream of bad news on my dad's phone it, I think I'll reduce the weight, standardize my form and make sure I can lift a lot consistently, tomorrow is legs day and to be honest, I am a bit worried about being able to lift 280 for 4 which is what I'm going for, or maybe 280 for 6 even hehe, I think I can do it, no I can do it, and I'll be lifting 315 real soon!! I'm sure I can do it for a rep or two already, but I need consistency people. Anyways off to read, I'll try not to scare myself too much, I'm switching out bent over rows for the rest dealt rows which was supposed to be there in the first.place, much nicer on my lower back, but yeah this was a semi long catch up

I don't know why I need a reason to be nervous. It's a human emotion, and I can say that for sure now because it's true. I didn't go to campus and stayed home alone for a few hours, I really didn't do anything productive? That's not the right word. It was a very banal time, I've almost finished my physics class and I want to finish gymtrovert quickly to start my other idea. ..I'll talk to you as everything goes tomorrow, we'll see very soon I guess. I'm listening to csught on fire now xD. I just need to take deep breaths. I will survive and I've done it before and I can do it again. It's just one day, and I need to calm down, oh

And I always thought that I just need to do the study with dr hill but I haven't asked him how much time I'll have to dedicate to do it, so either I do an internship with journi, or I find something new to do and improve my skills, I also have another idea of ​​an app that I want to create, and if I finish gymtrovert really fast, I'll be able to do it! ..Also there will only be three people presenting their projects, so I wanted to do it so I wouldn't disappoint him. But there are nine questions left in the physics subject, hmm. Other than that, if I want to find a good internship, and if I want to do it, I'll have to do it.

    Entry: I really don't know why I'm writing here, I don't have much to say but I want to, I didn't really do any work in MAD class but I'm making progress on my gymtrovert project, I lifted 315 for 6 reps today, then next week I'll try for 325 for 4 reps, we'll see, also I think I've said this before but I can do more pullups now. With more ease too. ..I'm planning my schedule for next week, and I only have one class on Monday and Friday, how awful 😭😂 , I'll have to stay on campus like this semester. But in other news, I'm feeling better about my worries from yesterday, I don't think I wrote them here yesterday because its something I've written about a lot in the past. So I decided not to write it down, I didn't go to the cru meeting so I have to catch you up when I see you. I'm pretty busy today, or I guess tomorrow, well, I guess not today or tomorrow. But I have things I'd rather do really quickly so I don't have to worry about it. I have the Lin alg test next week, I showed ben Ethan and andre my grade in lin alg finally xD, I also have my MAD project, my progress has dropped, a lot? Yes a lot, I don't really feel like working on it, but I'm still doing it so I'll continue, firebase screwed me I guess xD, that was a horrible expression and I'm sure it doesn't exist xD, but that's how I feel. There's a new subject in MAD, and I don't know, it looks a little difficult, but I'll survive. Or when I'm home, do I have to call? Dan because there's a problem in the code oee

I finally got to lift weights again! How exciting, I lifted 225 on inclines and recorded a video, my chest is already sore xD, and it’s going to be even more sore tomorrow, how exciting xD, I’m also going to wait until 9 to work out because the gym is usually emptier then. ..There are a lot of things that don't excite me anymore, hedonistic adaptation is coming again, in tdr, the food didn't excite me at all, I didn't even feel like eating it, and there was no cold ice cream :(, I didn't like staying in the library and I didn't like eating tdr's food, I don't want to spend time on campus anymore. ..In more exciting news, I'm going to buy a new phone. This phone is really really slow and old and I'm going to destroy it >:), it's the perfect plan. I think I have a meeting with dr mina tomorrow, I need to plan my schedule for the upcoming semester,

    Entry: This, has been the weirdest day in the longest time!! Woke.up feeling nice, i had a dream that I was part of the physical 100 and it was snowing outside, then my mum texted that she wanted me and eyitooni, or all of us maybe to make a video tribute for her 50th birthday and it was the funniest thing ever, we kept laughing about it but I decided to get it out of the way quickly XD. Then I got on a call with ben and he showed me around his project, we talked through some of the work, helped each other debug, it was pretty nice. Then I watched my neighbor totoro and spirited awaY, two very good movies!! I also made puff pastry with the goal of making a peach type desert and the one in the oven turned out pretty nice but small, and the one in the air fryer tastd like chicken, then I made another one with jam and I took the first bite and was surprised by how good it was!! Now I'm working on my android app after getting off of an scp call, the scholarship was fully awarded, 1000 dollars which was/is AMAZINGG, I didnt even register for it, it's super weird,..Ricardo helped me with the physics homework so I got done with it as well! Twas pretty nice, I should watch the simpsons now xD

    Entry: I almost forgot to write here today but here I am, still reading like agus for chocolate and it's very interesting, I woke up with a forgotten dream :(, but then I felt, well, I don't know, at first I thought that feeling was envy or jealousy, but maybe I also felt incompetent because I saw that ven was working on his project and it seems like it's complex etc etc, you know how I get, and then when I was playing les mills, I wanted to be honest with myself, and with him too, I'm talking to him and it's not worth hiding my feelings. So I told him how I felt ad that I felt like his project had more of a long term feel to it, and how mine all felt pretty short term and weak but then he kinda suggested ideas for snooz on how to make it more rounded and I do see the potential, I'll be working on it after my gymtrovert app and might not be able to present it before the semester ends but that's fine. ..But today I made good chicken!!! I made tortillas again, but this time I reduced the salt and it turned out pretty great, then I used some of the remaining chicken and followed a noel Denzel recipe and it was amazing, put the chicken lemon juice and garlic with seasoning in a ziplock bag and everywhere smelled so nice, it reminded me of summer last year, I really like how that has become a nostalgia moment for me and I'm glad it was because I did want it to feel that way, cooking takes my mind off things a lot, and it's really nice to have everything come together nicely, I'll make something nice again tomorrow, maybe this time with potatoes And less cheese. Also finished erased! It was a pretty nice anime, started belle but couldn't really get into it already know, and found this show called ths physical 100 Ns it's about these buff dudes who go through challenges to see whose physique is the most.applicable in most scenarios or sth lke that. I had a long convo witb hansel and vex today as well, we want to get into the liftimg 1000s club xD.

    Entry: Apparently I talk to my little brother when I'm sleeping and when he's sleeping too xD. How interesting. I keep reading like agus for chocolate and I can understand it pretty well, there are a lot of words I don't know. But I'm learning, I learned that nuts is walnut, almond is almond I think, and there are other words like balazos etc that I learned. ..I don't think I did anything new today, I started erased and I think I'll be able to finish it tomorrow! I continued with my gymtrovert project and now I understand more how firebase and getcurrentuser work, every time I used it, it always gave me null, and I didn't know why, until now, it seems that firebase auth hasn't loaded yet, because it's asynchronous, so if we use getcurrentuser, it's pretty useless because it doesn't know what we're referring to, so we have to use an authstatechsngedlidtener. I was also talking to dan and he said that he's paying a guy that works for him a hundred dollars! Every hour, so much money!!! I want to start working eee I think I'll ask my parents about the SSN. ..Or some unexpected news, I got another scholarship? I don't know, it was very surprising but I wrote my thank you letter, and sent it, and I'm not going to think about it anymore. I hope I can remember my dreams tonight! Lately, I don't know if I've told you this but I have a hard time remembering them, and I know I have interesting dreams!! I can't say I worked out today, but I want to get back to the gym, I need to gain more muscle and get stronger,! I want to bench press 250lbs before the end of this semester and I think my joints have enjoyed this break, I don't want to get tennis elbow or something.

    Entry: I feel good now, I think I'm happier when I'm with other people, talking to them etc etc, I don't know maybe I'm more extroverted than introverted, I say this because I just finished the little thing, the panel for student advisors at school. And I met new people, gentlemen! Not gentlemen like old people xD, seniors, but al was there. Andre wasn't. But we talked about our classes and he gave us advice, I had fun I guess, I get that feeling of excitement, it's small but it's there, I guess my gray moments lately- my sad moments essentially, well, I think the lack of direct communication with my friends has made me feel more isolated? I guess it's likely. ..Or I don't know if I said it the gentleman's name is Jose, maybe he speaks Spanish! I should have taken his number or Instagram or something..One of the counselors told me that she had seen me somewhere, I don't know, she seemed pretty familiar too but I don't remember her

    Entry: This is going to be maybe a long journal, so strap yourself in aradito, wes gonna be talking about "being comfortable being alone and in the present", I was going to write this in Spanish but It wouldnt encapsulate all my thoughts properly so I'll stick with english, now what do I mean when I say being comfortable being alone, lately, well not even lately, for a long time.now I've found that when I dothings, I usually frame them in the format of me telling them to other people, like this spring break "challenge" of doing something new per day, I was/am already thinking about how I'm going to frame it at a cru meeting or when I'mtalking with friends to make it seem more cool than it is in a way, and over the start of the break I've been continuously telling myself to only think of myself, like, stopxthinking about what other people will think, and it's becoming increasingly difficult as I dont seem to even be able to control my blody thought sort urges, as if I ever could!! ..It's kinda pathetic and I dont wanna use the - humans do it - argument cause I also think that that is kinda the cucks way out as well, weird way to use the word but it just fits, I find it hard to be in the moment. I usually just find myself on the floor all blech like, some YouTube video or anime is playing in the background and I'm just, blech, no emotions really, a gray plain sadness...I turned off my bluetooth and wifibeforr writing this, I dont even know why, it doesnt change anything, but I've felt very weighty lately, I might need a technology and an overstimulation detox, I guess my dopamine threshold has gone up and it takes more for me to feel that same excited feeling I get bouts of during the day to actually sink in? Ir my hormones just be messing up from my weird eating lol, but now I almost always am thinking of the future. What would tomorrow be like when I'm in campus, would I be in the campus lab, what would I be working on, I don't know if I was any different in the past, I was already planning where I'd live for bobs sake, but now it's like theres no moment where I'm just, here, except like maybe now for example, where I can just lay here and ponder over things like these, maybe I find it easier to live in the future cause I know what to expect, and expectinng validation from other people makes things even more tempting. ..Like while working on the mobileprojects, I felt like I was a lot more enthused about the idea of others seeing my project and prof nolan being happy about it, then actually feeling happy about building a fully functioning app from scratch. I was also thinking about this a bit previously in the day, where, as usual I was framing things in the light of a conversation with someone. This time it was ben since hes fhe one I usually have deeper conversations with, but I wa slike I no longer find joy in coding, I dont know it it was ever there, maybe I lost some important piece to the puzzle along the way, but now what I'm doing just feels like hitting a nail to a wall over and over again, not getting very far in terms of my general outlook of life? That last sentence was quite confusing even for me lol, but now everything is about other people, would other people like this project and want to use it, would another person, prof nolan, want to talk about this project to other students in the future? Would x person judge me on my muscles? Are those what distinguish me from other people? Gosh even when I'm playing beat saber, I find it fun to imagine other people around me complimenting me on my playstyle and it's a victimless crime that harms no one and I even like to do it in that one case at least, but it's much harder for me to just be in the moment and enjoy what I'm doing for the sake of doing it, coding, reading perhaps? I dontknow, I like reading even without others validation, coding is a big one. Even relaxing for Bob's sake!! Sometimes I see myself relaxing and talking to ben about how much I relaxed, or how much I didnt relax, like framing things in terms of me just being able to tell it to other people...Okay now that I've blabbed on, what can I get out of this? First thing, stop worrying or putting any focus on the future or its events to be honest. I forgot where I heard this today bjt it was a basic thing, all things come to an end, which is quite comforting.as it makes everything else feel pretty small, but I'll also want to internalize a mantra, thos usually help, here and now works, seems kinda corny, seems very corny, but if I just take deep breaths and refocus myself, first catch myself when I'm outer phrasing, terrible wording but I'll  use that, then I'll step back, maybe do something else and then try to come back to doing sajd thing for jjst that thing, for myself! Writing a whole essay here, I'll talk to you tomorrow and see how it goes, for now, here and now!!

Gonna be following my dad and the building will be open for the entire day so we'll see. ..Idk, I havent gotten the full chance to take a break this spring break, but then again its tuesday, but then again I dont like being unproductive, I didn't stick to my mission of only productive at 12am, I started working on the changes to the oee dashboard etc etc, and my gymtrovert project, also thought of another project to keep track of body progress in the gym. I'm watching Bob's burgers now but I still feel generally, Mehhhh and drained, meh and drained..Also played thrill of the fight and beat 3 Camila songs in a row

And I mean some things clicked. But some other things just went poof in my head, then I did the deed and now I'm just laying on the floor feeling overcast, unsure as to whether I should keep learning about it. Whether it will be worth it, etc etc, I'm also feeling overwhelmed about my new task for the coding club, which is making a sql query that goes based off time and I don't understand the structure of the system yet so everything is kinda blehc. I don't want to spend my break on work, but I also know that I feel best when I'm productive. I'll try my approach like winter of who knows when, I'll be productive.till 12 then I'll unlock my inner.potato. I think that gives me enough structure,2 hours left and time to put that to practice!

    Entry: Today has been a very relaxing day. It reminds me of summer days when I didn't work yet and nobody was home, very very relaxing times, I hope this summer will be like that. But i woke up to the sound of my dad and little brother arguing about cold showers, i tried to join in the argument but it got nowhere..Afterwards my dad went to school and i did a les mills session, i started gymtrovert, eep i haven't done my duolingo yet but i also tried making a quesadilla, it was a mess, i put too much salt in the dough so i couldn't use it :(, but on a more positive note, i decided to do one new thing each day of this break, like a new years resolution but different, today i switched my browser from chrome to opera gx and i really like it, honestly, that's something i did before i decided i wanted to do something new but i did that and didn't do anything new other than that so i'm not gonna complain. Also im poor at sky now xD, four new spirits came back from assembly season! So i bought some new cosmetics and now i'm gonna play sky more to get my candles back, but not only that, i want to play it with nyny, or lama. With other people in general, maybe I should make new friends...Now I'm sitting in the bathroom, and I need to read, then I'll see you!!..O And I finished odd taxi, it's a wonderful anime and it has a very very interesting plot twist

    Entry: It's hot :*), well not really hot but it's hot! I think i'm really close to finishing my snooz project and then during spring break, i can start my new project woop woop, it'll be great! But i'm really proud of snooz, it's something i can use to improve my dream memories, it'll be great, also i don't have to go to school tomorrow, or during the next week xD, i'll work more on oee's project and i think i'll join a call with dan to catch up. ..O finally! i bought inside the radius but to be honest, i don't like it that much, it's really scary, but ehh, the graphics don't appeal to me, i prefer red matter 2. I started, and i'm almost done oddtaxi! It's an interesting anime and i like it. ..O and i woke up really really really early, 4:30 - 5 a.m. early so I spent the beginning of the day scrolling through Reddit and quora :*), interesting start. I also joined a call with ben and andre to work on the project. I tried to learn more about ml and ai (specifically how gpt 3 works), it seems that it tries to predict the next words in a sequence of words, and an AI model is the result we get after training a lot of data. And the model predicts the result of our input after being trained on the data. So it takes a lot of data. Uses an algorithm, a machine learning algorithm to create a model that we can use to input new data and have the trained data and patterns found as a result of the algorithm to product a result. ...Also learned more about dockers, but im just trying to leave that to the side so I can learn it organically once it's time to start using it. Also played elemental battlegrounds with my brother. It was very interesting

    Entry: Just a normal, average day, no wifi for the first five or six? hours of the day, and I wanted to make a quesadilla but I wasn’t really hungry, so I read like water for chocolate anymore, and after slacking off for a few hours, I decided to continue my snooz project, and used openai to integrate autocomplete and image generation, its pretty cool, or awesome, but you know how I get when I do something AI related, I always think about how it works, and what am I doing, even today I was worrying because I didn’t know, or I thought I didn’t know what an ai model is but now I understand that when other people train their data with algorithms like linear regression, neural networks I also think, the solved thing is an AI model that we can use to gain access to the intelligence? Or how the ai works, I don’t know how to explain it, maybe I’ll talk more with lpen ai, I’m watching a video now xD. ..Hmm, I wanted to buy another game on vr! Into the radius, but my giftcard wasn't working :(, oh models are used to predict the outcome of an action, or something like that, it's a bit frustrating not knowing things like that, but I'm learning :(

We watched conjuring2, and I'm a little bit scared 😂😭, just a little bit XD, now I'm alone and waiting for my dad to arrive, it's snowing right now and they said the roads are really really bad, I hope my dad drives safely. ..I also have the scp call tomorrow, I can't wait for it to end. But it would mean I won't be able to have the coding club call, it's pretty frustrating but what can I do :*). ..Edit - my dad has arrived! Thank god..Edit 2 - the WiFi isn't working 😭😭, but at least there's light so I can't complain

So it's decided, i'm not bringing my vr :(, but it's okay, there are too many risks, but i also want to play beat saber in front of them, i'll leave the decision to myself tomorrow. ..Or i had a weird moment of happiness, but immediately after, i forgot why i was happy or motivated :(. I lifted 275lbs in the squat!! The gym was basically empty OR AND SOMETHING ELSE, magic mike was watching me, don't ask me why, i didn't finish it, but after i cancelled it, i felt really sad and tired, not why i cancelled it, but something else. Tomorrow i have no classes or anything, just because of the seed party :(

    Entry: I just decided to go into the past and see my messages and look what I found, that just lifted my freaking spirits up!! So what if your vr scratches, it's not the end of the world and you've done it before, if daddy picks me early, it's something I csnt control and I wouldnt want to make him wait after working, what am I worrying about, concerning my.goals, I'll reach them but it will take a bit of time and dedication but as long as I take things one step at a time. I'll find my way, I'm imagining my perfect self giving me a pat on the shoulder, I've been putting a lot of emphasis on material things lately, my vr being the prime case, everything will be fine and work itself out. ..Now heres a message for even more futhre older me, even though things may be bad, you're worrying about something physical, you arent reaching a goal you wanted, or some unforeseen event is throwing you off track, calm down, calmate, go to God for help, something I've been severely lacking in doing recently, deep breaths, things would work out, and if they dont, then at least yojre not dead and you can fix it! If your vr scratches, the dude had the tip about how to fix them and it worked, HE USED SANDPAPER for crying out loud, like yeesh, everything will be fine

    Entry: I'm such a hypocrite igh and dont have enough willpower or self disciple to follow through on the things I say and its Honking annoying, today was full of impending stress, jolly happiness and sheer disappointment in myself. For the good news first, sky beta had an updoot and brought the new season, season of passage, it has pretty unique quests but doesnt give us a new area and the stories are quite disconnected, but it does give us a glimpse into new areas. ..Then I had a call with dan to catch up etx etx, gonna work on more of the stuff tomorrow, along with physics homework, got 7 questions in and gonna try to make it halfway through by tomorrow. Then ahh i got home, washed my.vr and  because of a weird sensual dream I had, you can already imagine the downhill motion, twice 😭 ahhh it's frustrating especially cause I really do want to give something up for lent! Ugh!!!! And I'm just thinking of cru meetings and it makes me.even angrier and sadder and more disappointed in myself UGH..But now I'm just crying over spilt milk and can only move forward, il have faith in my ability to beat this ish. In other positive news, I made more progress on my dream app and I think it's ready for debut, imma use it tonight, hopefully I dream of nothing weird. I'll be finished with the picture of Dorian gray by the end of the week, at first I liked it but as I kept reading it, the conversations started to drag on, not a lot of action and a lot of the statements dont make any sense...Also I'm still getting that impending stress feeling about bringing my vr to school, the same one I got actually again when I wanted to bring my vr to school last time..I'll make it, I'll survive, I played the rollercoaster game and the painting game and it was pretty fun, I could give into this feeling, the easy way out, and not bring my vr, but then I'm also looking at an alternate reality where I do bring my vr and play beat saber and everyone is like :0, even if I try to make a definite decision like **yes, I'll bring it and stop thinking about it**, it never lasts, ughh I hate this feeling, lo odio con todo mi ser. Es frustrante y ahora, estoy aguitado pero esta sensación pasará eventualmente, solo necesito una noche de dormir buena, a pleasant dream, and a plan, I have to figure out a way to carry my vr with me without potentially scratching parts of it, I should buy a case to put it in ;-;

    Entry: Pretty normal day, learned that gene from cru speaks italian, or is learning it, and he travels a lot, very random and irrelevant detail, don't pay attention to me xD. I've been farting all day 😭, I need to find out what affects my stomach, or and today I had another weird dream, and also I made more progress on my snooz project :D, also after waking up, I spent, maybe an hour? Not thirty minutes scrolling through reddit and youtube, how lazy :*). ..And now I'm hungry, I deadlifted 315 for 4 reps today, and it was very. Very, VERY exhausting, I sweated so much, my body can't take it 😭😭, at least my back doesn't hurt!! That's great, I'm happy with my tech, but it can always improve, I felt like all the people in the gym were looking at me xD, at seed, we have a party on Friday, I'm going to bring my vr, and I don't have classes, so that will be great, but also I don't know, that might be the only day I don't need to go to school, and I'll have a three day break- on Friday with the end of the week, combined with spring break... it will be wonderful, but I also need to exercise etc etc. I forgot about my duolingo streak yesterday xd so I did a lesson this one. Tomorrow. We're home now, I'm going to wash my vr

That was shadowing.jezelle and andrew, so I had lunch with them, which was pretty fun. Had a good lfiting day and felt energized/pumped after it! It's also raining, good rain! Cloudy skies, nice temperature, we had fun in class with dr mina saying entity and ben saying en titty, she called andre angry andre and there was a person shadowing andre as well. ..Hmmm, saw a crow in the morning, lolalso in the morning, my.brother was taking a lotta time to get ready so we just left him. Also no more sore throat and I was pretty productive as well, made progress on my snooz app, a lotta progressactually, I might need to add more features, but I want to get the recycler view part done, I'm also gonna be using gpt 3 somehow in this project, tis gonna be fun

    Entry: I’ve been thinking about this person, this one little lonely person, and it’s been bothering me all day, you know his name and I don’t want to talk about him aaaawhen I think about him, I judge him, and I don’t want to judge him, I try to analyze his actions too, I do it too much and usually I know I’m wrong and I’m being stupid but I can’t stop doing it, I think he’s lazy, he’s incompetent, he’s deceitful and he always wants attention, that person, is love, lol no. If I was a kid writing in my Journal, which is technically what I’m doing right now, I wouldn’t be able to. But that’s not important. It’s so frustrating because I don’t even want to think about him, I don’t want to think bad things about him and his attitude. And I know that I’m even being a hypocrite when I judge him because I usually do the same, and I know that even though I say that I don’t want to talk about this guy. I'm talking about him now, but that's just because I want to release my frustration ..Now I'm going to change the subject, I watched many many many episodes of bobs burger, and I made a lot of progress on my snooz project :D, which is cool I know, and many times something that happened on bobs burgers also happened in real life, like vex will talk about something and they will say something related, like he was talking about the metric system and on bobs burgers, Tina was debating against or in support of it. But yeah, I watched a lot of episodes. Hmm, my mom went to do a pjotodhoot with my older brother, and I used that time to do basically nothing, but I did yoga, it's been a long time since I did that! It was a short routine and I was pretty distracted, but I finished it. I can't wait to work out tomorrow, push myself hard!! Lifting more weights etc etc

I decided to replace it with not eating sweet food or anything like that, you know, but you can imagine my mom brought that cupcake, and I ate it 😭, and I thought about my "promise", but I was hungry, and my brain was like, hey dude, let's eat it, it's not a decision, oh I can't control my brain!..I also want to iceskate again aaaa. I know I'm going to forget this feeling, but leave me alone and let me feel it😭😭, I got the call from the coding club, I wrote code, I listened to the music, everytime I think about the coding club, I feel like I'm forgetting something 😭. Or and I had a really weird and interesting dream, noah was there, and the people from pitch perfect? ​​And someone was talking about psychedelics in a sky realm, sky queen? I don't know, but it was a really weird dream. My throat hurts, but it's better than before, and I downloaded a new game, well, I played a new game, climb, in vr, very interesting

    Entry: Today when I woke up, my whole body hurt!!! My arms, my legs, my soul 😭😭, but I went to school and exercised, next week, I will change my routine with new exercises, I can't wait >:), I'm going to try even harder! MORE!! Harith found out that mofe is my older brother and he was very surprised but I got a congratulations loll, i am bigger, or according to them, i am bigger/muscular than him, it is a very heavy crown but I am ( switching to english to be able to articulate my thoughts better ), but I'm better than making that part of my.identity, I've already separated myself enough from that life and I don't need it catching back up on me...But other than that, I survived the African/Caribbean meeting, there was food there, and it was delicious, but I also think I've mentioned this here a few times, but I don't really connect with the Nigerian culture, well, much, I think I belong more to the Hispanic culture, it's quite silly, but sorry 😭, in Nigeria I felt it, and now when I'm around a lot of Nigerians, I feel that same feeling, but I want to get into the conversations when people from seed are talking in Spanish or about their food, they were talking of papusas and chicharrones😭😭, how delicious :*), and, well, I wanted to say that I can't change culture or races, but I feel more comfortable around people who experience Spanish culture, so I don't think there's anything wrong with surrounding myself with people who make me feel happy, so I'm not going to force myself to feel more comfortable around Nigerians, or with the comfort level that I feel around seeds, they were talking about the music club members that were part of it bringing their instruments and playing music and everyone singing and I was a bit terrified 😂😂😭, I made eye contact with the lady that runs the things and I don't know if she noticed it, but I was like.noO nO no no nOpE😭. I hope we don't do that at our next meeting 😭...Oh oh it was very productive today too. I finished two linear alg tasks, yesterday I finished the design of the new component in the OEE project and today, I designed it :D, we also did the physics test, and I talked to ben about psychedelics and that he wanted to try it xD, it's very very random, but it was an interesting conversation xD, it feels like theres another entirely untouched aspect of our existence and experiences like Lucid dreaming, oh I had a dream about handball football in echo vr! It was a weird dream, but yeah experiences like that are available to us and I don't want to waste opportunities like that

Started the day off pretty well and chose to go to school an hour later, did some physics work and then got a workout in, my legs were sore from yesterday's les mills workout 😭 but I pushed through leg day, then I went to the fish bowl to get some work done, also the car was frozennn and everywhere looked pretty with frosted trees but those are besides the point. ..Here comes the fun part, going Ice skating OOOOOOOOO, we got there and ben and I almost.forgot about it loll, but we were able to make it and at first I put on the boots and realized that they are surprisingly easy to walk in, I dont know, I thought it would be harder xD. Guess I was wrong, the first boots i got were too tight so I got a size 14. Then to start skating, I fell like, 10. 20 times 😂, but those were almost falls. I actually fell like 5 times but it didnt matter much to me. My shoulder does hurt and towards the end. I started getting cramps.😭😭  I need to figure out why I be cramping yo, I guess my body sweats a lot and loses.electrolytes and since I dont have a way to replenish it, them cramps be coming. It was super fun tho, ben stayed at the sidelines and didnt skate much 😭, but the more I did it, the better I got at skating which was pretty cool. andrew was really good and some.people in the background were cheering me on 😭😂  or at least that's what I think. ..But then i got super sweaty, my clothes wet, i still had mobile app class to go to. But got it out of the way, now headed home super tight and sore, gonna work on the figma model and try to get er done. I have enough time..Then I talked to ben about brother hood.

But it works now, Crisis averted. If it doesn't work in the future, I don't know if I will do 😭😭, I hope not, positive energy, positive vibes. ..Hmm, what's more, I took the test for the database class, and I got a grade of 33.7/34, very good :D, very very good. I also joined a call with dan and tomorrow I'm going to work on the figma model, continue my snooz project, finish my physics homework and study more because I don't understand even dad :*), I only have two classes, or and good news! We're going iceskating tomorrow for seed, how interesting, and I can't wait :D, it's something new and I've never done it in the past, well, to be honest, I always want to be honest with you because there's no point in lying, that just means that im lying to myself, but right now I'm not feeling too excited, but I know that when it happens and when it's happening and we're skating, I'm going to enjoy it a lot a lot a lot, I know it! ..Now I want to read a little bit and then go to sleep,

    Entry: Something interesting happened today, I felt annoyed, well angry, annoygry lol for real for the first time in a while, and it was on something petty too lol, and i randomly keep playing the conversation over in my head, it was in phys lab and we needed help with a question so we asked the other table about it, and this dude was.lik, he was hearing a lot of talking from our table and not a lot of working, which kinda annoyed me, Nobel helped tho XD, and I brushed it off, I think, but ahh this is gonna sound cringe but we made like a solid 2 second eye contact lol, uncomfortable eye contact that is, but yeah I dont think it showed a lot and I I wasn't gonna start a fight or a diss back, anyways worked out and it went pretty quickly I'm enjoying deload week, studied some more for database, played chess and got some elo back LOL..Cru was also nice, met a new dude called gene, not his real name more like a nickname, I want to give up something for lent, what would it be though, echo vr, would be too hard to give up unfortunately, but maybe its needed. And its something that'll actually affect me, entertainment wise I guess, not a big issue, but still yeah. I ate a lotta cheese today from cru XD, but didnt eat breakfast so I hope that balances it out 😭. Gonna work on the physics homework a bit more tonight, same with the linear algebrahomework, I was quite hungry at the library so my head space wasnt into it,..Also apparently now andre and Joseph are dating, that's pretty cool, I'm happy for them I suppose, nothing against it, hope he makes her happy. We gonna be planning the charity class club event and we'll see how it goes. Hopefully better than the flipping scp thing, that just reminded mex I need to ask Jordan to resend an email to mark, gonna do that now even without wifi cause headed home, but yeah I've been reading more of the picture of dorian wilde and I like it, I like it..Actually you know and I know what I need to give up for lent, let's start this and put cru teachings to good use AAA

I finished my database class project, and tomorrow I'm going to start and finish the zodiac project for MAD. I'm also going to try to finish physics, it's also my rest week, so I'm not going to lift a lot of weights. I had a sky dream too where I was playing with nyny 😂..It was a beautiful dream, I also joined a call with ben and worked on his project. My mom's birthday is coming up really fast and I realized that she's going to turn 50!! So we're going to some fancy restaurant!! With steak and sushi and all that, I'm dying to go, well, really not, but I'm excited because it's going to be a new experience, I'm sleepy so I'm going to sleep. Recently, I've been feeling like my Spanish has faded away :(, I know I have points in my life where I feel this way and I have other points or times where I feel like my Spanish is wonderful, so I know this feeling will leave me very soon. ..I also started a new book called the picture of dorian wilde and it's quite interesting, it has a very luxurious and prestigious style of writing, but I like it

Un mes más 😭, y después intenté hacer una tortilla española pero salió mal, muy mal entonces no lo hice 😭😭, después jugué echo, más echo, tal vez roblox, etc etc, el punto is that I didnt get much work done, so when I found out that ben already did his mobile app project and was starting his assignment 2, I was like ooop, so i decided to get working on my assign 2, which brought 2 issues, 1 is the issue of getting motivated off another person, like I didnt want to fall behind so I sacrificed - a big word - my comfort, I made some.good progress though, but secondly, I started getting annoyed about not understanding how mysql works in the background with its server and stuff,..I'm just going to calm myself and remember to learn organically, I'm using new tech and learning new stuff every day,well, most days lol, but I'm also going to be using mysql in our reimbursement project so I can chill down and realize that I'll be fine in the end, I can make projects for myself that use mysql and keep getting better over the summer and stop relying on firebase!!..But yeah echo was so funny, I was so close to making a shot and I missed it, so close to the goal 🤣🤣  I couldntstop laughing

I really wanna finsih my gpt 3 project pretty quickly, I was able to train the model this morning, it's pretty bad but it's kinda funny lol, I've been debating on going to campus tomorrow but I wanna work on the physics exam with the others and also workoit so I guess I'll be on campus. ..Alsl I'll get to eat good food LOL, I'll use the opportunity to get some.really good.progress on the project so that I can woek properly with my sleep app, which I have a few ideas for, from being able to track sleep to having a calendar feature like jefit, all that shebang, all the other sleep apps feel pretty bloated with ads, maybe I'll get it to do some push notifications too. I know I wont be able to finish the gpt 3 project tomorrow. But I think I can make it work 😭, especially since I'm following the same.theme as the already made tifu one, gonna add some new features as well, that's about it tho, feeling a tad bit overwhelmed, when ben feels overwhelmed, I start to feel overwhelmed as well, or I guess it just draws attention to how I feel, tis fine tho.

I couldn't resist the temptation;(..I still look pretty chubby 😭, I'm eating a lot and my face shows it, tomorrow I'm going with the seed people to a little place near udm, a pizzeria or something, I've been eating a lot, but I've also been making progress at the gym, I'm lifting more weight every day, and I already know that my cardio is suffering 😭, maybe I should do cardio after working out!

So I took a cold shower as usual, I didn't eat anything but it's okay, then I worked out, I lifted 285 for five reps, it was very hard but I did it and now my back hates me 😭😭, I'm sorry, but I'm getting stronger at pull-ups! And that's really good news. ..Then, I worked on the linear algebra test with Irene, and something funny happened 😭, I was rushing - in a hurry - to CRU, and I forgot to turn in my test!! So then I realized and emailed her, she told me its ok 😭, and luckily, I got 75/70, perfect, oh no, its not perfect, there were two chances for extra credit 😭😭 I'll see what question I got wrong, I haven't answered heyzol yet, I just answered her, life is good lol. After cru, I walked Ethan to his car and he reparked his car, a very very trivial detail, but I forgot to say HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY TO YOUR POOR LITTLE boy all alone 😭😭, I ate chocolate! ..Hmmm, that's more than more, or and then, it was very, productive, I finished the mobile app dev application, started the project design for database systems, oh there's a new project there, and I forgot 😭😭. I'll add it to my todo list. But yeah, now I don't feel lazy like yesterday and Sunday, im pumpeddd!! And productive ay! I want to play a little bit of echo vr, but I might not be able to do that, so I'll just continue the mobile app design..O and I sent a message to adeife!! And I started French in language transfer

    Entry: Now I feel a lot better, I watched the simpsons episodes and started the lin some test, now I'll be able to finish it tomorrow, hopefully it'll be easier done than said xd, my headache has reduced, thank god, and I connected on a call with the four ducketeers, and we worked on our database assignment, other than that, I didn't do much today, I started the day feeling lazy but as the day progressed, I got more.productive and now I'm kinda in productive mode lol, but that doesn't mean I wasn't productive today, well, well, I kinda was, earlier today that is, tomorrow I'll work more on my .mobile app dev assignment and continue with the reddit.project aa!!! I haven't made much progress on that one after. I didn't have the call with dr qian because I didn't make any big changes so that was good, she saw the email from firebase saying that the rules are not secure and I hoped she wouldn't see that xD, but I clarified it B), now we have more people in the physics group, I think hayzol sent me a message but I didn't answer her 😭, I will do it later but now bye, see you

And I will try to put it into practice

    Entry: I'm learning more about backend techno, but I can say!!! That openai worked!! How cool I know xD, I can finish my new project and do more stuff like that, that's amazing, and now I think I'm ready to do more stuff with machine learning, I'm pretty excited..I finished velma and. I played a lot but a lot of vr. Now I'm going to explain a little bit how the backend works, and I know I'm doing it to solidify the idea in my brain ooll but it feels like a big veil just got swept over my head, usually in the front end,I use npm to serve files, but we can use a backend ourselves, like go and listenandserve, so when we do that, we can build.our front end file and listen on the backend for /, then show the file, after that, we can now have our. Backend use sqlite to run queries and store data etc etc, which it can then place in apis as json thay the frontend will use. SPLENDID, ..I'm learning a lot, but there are many things I still don't know, and it doesn't matter because every day I learn something new! Apart from that, today I've been a total slacker xD, a huge potato, it's not that cold, and in the duck, I think we're finally going to play dnd!! And I had a nice dream where I was playing echo vr but as a real player

Hmm, that's more than anything, or something that's been bothering me, Allen congratulated me today xD, or but I mean I'm improving my echo skills, especially as a goalie, but yeah! He compared me to my older brother - Andrew now knows I have an older brother, and he said I'm smarter, more muscular, something and some than him, I don't feel like thinking about it because I don't want to inflate my ego any more than it already is, but it makes me feel happy xD, I'm so dumb loll, but now I'm not worrying as much as yesterday, and now I want to get stronger xD because they were talking about how much weights I can lift, and I didn't want to answer 😭😭😭, ..Maybe I'll use the smith machine xD, but thinking about it scares me xD, now I want to sleep, tomorrow I'll tell you how openai goes and if it was a success or not, I hope so!!

    Entry: Okay now i feel better, i think i've finished my navigatour project, and now, i'm getting a little worried about creating an app that i'm going to use, but i can always create more apps!! So i don't have to worry because even if i create something and i don't use it, like my anime site, it doesn't mean i didn't learn something new in the project, and now i want to scrspe r/tifu on reddit, and use it with gpt 3, i'm not too excited about it right now, but i know that when i start, i'll feel better!! And i'll think of more ideas. ..On a less personal note, bing just created an integration with gpt chat and it's very interesting, and google tried to do the same but they failed xD, it's very entertaining. I'm almost done with language transfer in italian again, and i like talking to nyny in italian spanish and english, i like the moments we spend together and now i think i'm getting over the fear of talking to her and other people on the server! ..I also want to take pictures again! I’ve been doing this for a long time, and now when I do it, it’s very familiar! Like I told you before xD. I don’t know how to explain it, but it calms me down, another thing that calms me down is food lol, but if now I don’t want to and I’m going to stop thinking about it so much, tomorrow I don’t have classes or anything, then I’m going to stay in, aaa I can’t!!! I have to take the physics test tomorrow with the others 😭, yuck, I know I don’t need to do it, but I already told jezelle that I’m going to help her! ..Now I want to sleep, and read a little, I’ve spent too much time on echo, and I love it, I’m improving a lot, and although I don’t win all the games, it is very fun to play!

I'm having one of those useless worrying moments again, but I think I'm getting better at it, which is something I've been saying for about 2 years now, but it's a slow constant process, now it no longer encapsulates me, I can catch myself pretty quickly, I'm honestly not sure.about my facial expressions, maybe they reveal a lot and I'm worried about that as well LOL, but anyways that's besides it all. ..I didn't go to the career fair, didnt feel like it, and honestly rn I don't have a lot to say lol, I really wanna play echo, and mr b talking about his project now fueled another fire in me, which I guess I shouldn't perceive as bad, motivation to not fall behind!!! Imma work on recycler views later, but yeah I usually overthink stuff like this, but I'm getting better!!! Incentivize catching yourself rather than beating yourself about catching yourself

    Entry: Ugh today was a big blur of frustration, confusion, was I even productive? Yeah that, might as well start from the beginning, had a pretty nice dream, that felt pretty realistic, I think I'm getting back to being able to understand my dreams more. Anyways then went to skewl and worked out, pretty normal,got to the library and tried to start looking up stuff related to fine tuning a gpt 3 model, then went down a rabbit hole of ideas and their difficulty levels, wanted to do something with my daylio data but [ this is just a way for me to remember LOL] finetuning requires a prompt completion type datasets, which I cant really make with this data, so I could just find some data on kaggle and use it ....I'll come up with an idea eventually, it's just pretty demotivating, and ben was asking why I felt frustrated lol, I guess it was obvious. I did relax after a while though, nolan hasnt responded yet and we had the marcomm call today, which was pretty okay...I didnt work on any navigatour work today, but im.almost done with physics..Took a pic of the sun today and it felt kind of nice, really familiar, I don't know why I stopped taking pics in the first place to be honest

    Entry: Okay today, I had one of the worst experiences at the gym!! Well so far xD, I was sweating so hard!! And there were like, eight people there, but still 😭, I couldn't stop sweating, yuck, but at least I hit a pr in deadlifts, one arm rows I think, and pullups, six pullups, now they're easier but I can still increase my strength!! Ehh. I used my new boots today, oh my dad is here, oops I guess not. They are very comfortable,..Today,I think I did a good job of catching myself when I was having bad bad thoughts, not bad bad as in bad bad, but like unproductive thoughts, of course its annoying to put up with, but now. I valued my thoughts more, well, I'll put more worth on catching myself and stopping the thoughts, being able to move on with my life. Than feeling bummed out about having the thoughts in the first place. If I put too many expectations on myself. It would usually end in failure 😭..But yes, now Ben wants to use flutter with the project, why? I don't understand but at least it's something new, he wants to learn a lot of things, so now I can catch myself judging him, and I can't do that after what I just said xD, don't judge other people!! Now I'm going home

It's going to be very useful and exciting, I still have problems with mister a, and I find that I get quite passive aggressive with him, well, a bit, oh it's just that, aaa I have too many useless problems 😭😭, I worked a little bit on physics, it's about vectors and I need to practice more, but it's okay it's okay. I'm not sleepy, I don't know why I wanted to say that but there you go xD. ..Tomorrow, deadliftss, I progressed on bench press! 235 for 6, which was a pr based on 1rm, not weight lifted, but I'm fine with rhat. When I do chest day. I find that I destroy and fatigue my chests a lot, which is great xD. I made a lot of progress on the navigatour project too, and I think I'll finally be able to finish it this week, or at least, next week, and that means I'll be able to work - one, on the reimbursement project for dr mina. Two, on another more fun project where I can use AI, I'm still thinking about making a gpt chat for myself xD. that'll be cool. Hmm, i have to have a test data, and I don't know how I'll do that. But we'll cross that bridge when we reach it. ..I ate some really nice food, I don't have much to say after that, I didn't see the guy you know today, and now I'm leaving

I dont mind it. Then my head started hurting again, it doesnt feel like a headache, just tightness in my neck.

Pise gave me an idea, I want to make a site for all the things I've learned, something new. Like a journal, but for more intellectual stuff, I have a lot of ideas now xD. ..I made a lot of progress on navigatour, and I think if all goes well, I'll be able to finish the app in, like, two weeks, a week and a half, let's see. I bought chegg too!! And now I can do my physics homework!! It takes a long time, but now it's not impossible 😭😭. ..Hmm, I played chess with ben and Josefina, I won of course xD. I found new songs by Roy shakked and now his songs are stuck in my mind 😭😭. Or I wore my new boots!! They are a little uncomfortable, but I like them, when I get home, I'll have the call with Daniel, hmmm, or and I played with lama today!!! I met her friends...Edit ..This is an edit from future me but something has been bugging me, it's quite funny, I don't know why but I usually.think of Andrew- rios - as like someone I took under my wing, idk he gives son vibes 😂, but today I just realized that he was about 19 and to be 20, it's still not clicking in my head 😂  maybe cause he looks so young??, this is gonna give me a headache I tell you. ..Im.also. back to journaling my dreams again!!!

Para serte honesto, well  I enjoyed today honestly, I didnt make much progress on mapbox which ruined my mood a bit, but I dined with andre ethan and josephine, database class was fun and my workout was okay, my chests were dead at the end, I have to stop chasing numbers and focus on being able to lift the weights properly 😭😭, but at the end of the day, perfect form is overrated and I think my form is pretty good. And I'm even already pretty sore, my back was sore throughout the day  ..Ugh I didn't read, wlll I read how people grow, but mapbox occupied my time and echo vr as well, its getting g removed and we get free stuff!!! Its such a different vibe but it was pretty nice. I also got new shoes I'm gonna flex tomorrow for leg day..O and I met some cool people. Well 2 in sky beta lol, one person called victor

Daniel wants to have a call to talk about changes to the site, and I wrote more code to change a few things. Bobby is not there anymore :(, someone killed him xD. I found out that Carlos from the physics lab speaks Spanish too, I'm finding a lot of people who speak Spanish and it's very exciting!! Maybe I'll be able to incorporate the language more into my everyday life. ..I couldn't resist the temptation, and to be honest, I feel bad about it 😭😭, especially after the cru session. God forgive me, I feel weird too, BUT in other news, I lifted a lot of weights on the deadlifts!!!! - deadliftz, and I think that very soon, I'll be able to deadlift 315lbs! Wish me luck. ..I felt a little bad today, because I've been feeling a little bad lately, not in general, but when I think that I have memories that I can't/won't remember, it's quite sad because sometimes a new memory comes up, and I wish I had written there, especially when I was around 13 ish and started making bigger changes, I started running outside, especially in the snow which brought nice memories, I was coding with the coding club at durfee, I started working out and learning more about nutrition, got into photography and wanting to be vegan. Ultimately a lot of these have fallen by the wayside, vegan and photography for sure, which is kind of a bummer, I have a camera and I should use it more, but other things have stuck like working out and coding, and I've picked up new hobbies like language learning and cooking, sadly sky isnt considered a hobby loll, but yeah I've grown in some ways, gone back in others, I learn stuff and forget stuff, that's life. I also have a weird fear of reading back at my Spanish journals, I'll try that now..See you tomorrow, also when I finish the nsvigstour project, I want to do the project with the anime faces and Morse code and then, my ai self

And so did jezelle, weird, but then I wanted to start homework 2, but nooope, just as bad as the first one...Seconfly.made a snowman with andre and josephine loll, talked to this well spoken dude who also spoke spanish, hes the dude that touches the mammalary glands of andre LOLL. My hands were super cold lol, but it was nice. Then I did some cardio while watching southpark, just.like 30 mins, then went to the comp lab to do some more work, more like play chess and talk to ben LOL, but he was telling me how he pr ed on every exercise, before that pise was telling me about bash and I felt overwhelmed, just a lil bit, about everything i still font know, but its a feeling I have to get used to if I wanna survive in this field, but yeah back to the prs, then I wanted to feel happy for him but that blody voice ugh, well it doesn't even say anything at this point, just secrets it's weird chemicals in my brain, the drink of envy. ..It's like an irrational fear or envy. It's hard to be angry at the person I am, or think I am, and want to do something to change it, but then usually end up feeling helpless against it, this is why I need a therapist

Then I'm stuck with finding better data, using the small images, doing the blink morse code one, or navigatour, so that kinda brought me down in the dumps...Akso my younger brother is now learning html and css..., idk how I feel about it, i should be excited, well. I shouldnt even say should, I'm not obligated to feel anything and I'm using a standard for how I should feel that makes me feel bad about not feeling that way, I dont feel especially threatened, I see a lot of younger me in him as we are going through the same.phases technically lol, its weird. I'm weird, you're weird brain. I think I'm mostly sad about not having a WOWW idea for mobile app,ni want to do something that would.please others and be something that nolan will tell other students about but I wouldn't even be there to hear about it, and in the end it's just a grade, I should focus more on the process I know, but I really do want to make something that others use, but at the end of the day, I can only make something that I can use, navigatour would ve pretty useful for when I'm going to new places, anime faces would be fun for a while but would probably get boring with no one to test it on, yadda yadda yadda. At the end of the day, I should stop seeking validation from other people in my results and do something that I think I'll enjoy, ugh I sound like ben lol...I do wonder if I can make my own chat gpt esque thing with the data from here ,I'll sleep on it

Snow and trees, chefs kiss, the gym center was closed :(, and I went to the fitness center to continue the lin alg test, and then, I met Irene! Oh I need to check on Instagram to see if she messaged me or something, but ethan encouraged me to talk to her in Spanish, and at first, I asked her where she was from, and she replied that she's from Spain, what a coincidence and excitement! She also has friends from Spain, but I'm getting ahead of myself, ..So we chatted, mixed English with Spanish and she told me that my Spanish is good xD, and I complimented her English too. Then one of her friend came over and we introduced ourselves. I see her around campus, and I hope I can talk to her in Spanish too. Afterwards. I had the physics test. And it wasn't too hard. A little confusing, but not bad, I did it with many many people, Andrew, Jezelle, Ricardo, many XD. Afterwards I worked out, went to the seed meeting, I want to do the I study with dr hill, but I want dr Carmona to answer me!! The deadline is in four days! If he doesn't answer me, I'll do my practice with dr hill, I don't hate the idea, but let's see, let's see. ..Simon and ben had a snowball fight XD, and I had me some food at tdr, alone too. Database class was fun. And I want to do, well, I wanted to do a project with maps and navigations, it's not a bad idea to be honest, and maybe I'll work more on it, but we'll see.

    Entry: Han actualizado la aplicación!! Es bastante interesante, and there was a snow storm here!!! And even though I love the snow, unfortunately I didnt go outside, but it really really threw me off, so so off oml, started the day feeling out of place. ..I decided I had to do sth about it, so first I made some brunkfast,It was pretty nice. Rice with coleslaw, no chimken, breh I forgot the chimken, plantain yadda yadda. Then I used a spinning wheel website to choose what I wanted to do. And the first three times on the same site, it landed on oee, so I was like nopes and used a different site. Landed on oee there too loll, I didnt really feel like it, but I still decided to get er done and made some good.progress. pushed the code to github, but I'd used a considerable chunk of the day ( also I just mistakenly closed out of Daylio, thank God the text saves), but that reminded me of another part of the day..I saw that ben had started on the template for his mobile app project, so I wanted to start at least mocking mine up, it's going to be a much much harder project than I thought, but if I find a good api, I can use the coordinates of 2 points to create a map data for the user, hopefully everything turns out well! We'll see, I designed the log in page and a smol part of the main page ..Anyways I continued with the oee project, I decided not to go on campus. Classes were online anyways, no point, so I believe I did a les mills workout after, twas brutal but felt nice. Also played some.echo and beat saber. Then linear algebra got released - the test, whoopee, I spent a good 4 plus hours working on it, and most of the hours was spent being stuck on stoopid question 2, I'm going to talk to dr zhong tomorrow, hopefully she can help. I'm doubtful, but it's better than nothing. ..I'll also be meeting with irene mañana y le.voy a hablar sobre hablando con ella en español y I already know that it's going to be super awkward ygh, I dont even know how to go about it, whatever happens happens! Josephine also texted me on ig and I dont wanna start texting her much, ugh I'm getting the same vibes from her as I do when I used to text, DUDE  I forgot her name 😭😭😭😭 dictioness😭😭, ugh, anyways, I still feel out of place and like the day wasnt very productive, but I think I learned quite a lot from doing the linear algebra test. I'm going to work on the physics test with jezelle and andrew tomorrow..Also started the lycoris recoil anime, I didnt love it at first but it got better, it's not as good as wonder egg tho, or kabaneri.  What else did I do today, won a kahoot in database class loll, hmm ..Another thing that made me feel really out of place was A boy, future me will prolly understand, I'm probably overloading it but i felt like I was not very self aware? Today. Everything just felt really really really off. I did have good laughs and a good time in database class. I dont know how I feel about being called a prodigy, doesnt appeal to me, I dont hate it, I cant control others perceptions of me but I can control my perception of myself, I feel like theres something big I should be taking out of this. Take moments during the day to analyze your thoughts and motivations? Today I felt like I pushed my inner voice away , also ate way too many mozzarella sticks, but in the future, I'll try to be more.conscious of my inner voice, right now it feels dulled or maybe that's just cause I'm tired lol. A bit of both, the linear algebra work presented me with a problem that hours of research couldnt help,..Also had a funky dream .lol

    Entry: I also don't have much to say today, I finished my physics homework and bought the textbook, but there's another subject eh, I'll start it tomorrow, well, I want to study with the videos and stuff like that etc. Etx before I start. ..It's going to snow a lot tomorrow!! I can't wait, Irene, the one who speaks Spanish, wants to take the lin alg test with me!! I'm going to use the opportunity to talk to her in Spanish! I need to do it 😭😭😭, ahhhh it will be very strange and uncomfortable. But I have to get out of my comfort zone to survive and learn and increase my skills, my exercise today was great, I lifted a lot in the deadlift, and I didn't eat much, but I ate a lot of ice cream. My stomach hurt but thank God it's gone now! I finished kabaneri of tje iron fortress and worked with figma, I think my skills have improved a lot :D

    Entry: Eeo now I feel bad, a little bad. I've already told you everything I want to say for today, so I guess I'll see you tomorrow, I'm watching module bundlers videos, they still confuse me, and it's very frustrating, I just want more, I need to remember that I should learn organically, and I should stop trying to force knowledge in my head

    My mood Great
    
    Entry: Okay I'm gonna say happy ish even though I feel kinda rad, actually you know what, I'm gonna switch fo motivated, which should be full green! Nah back to rad, great will do. So I started the day asusually, woke up thank God, and went to skewl, the gym was CROWDED, like packt, no space at all, there was a group working out there and I hope they dont makeit an everyday thing, if they do imma start working out at nine! Anyways ..After working out, decided to work on golang and socket.io, didnt make any progress and it bummed me out, A LOT. Cause I realized that there is still a lot I dont know, I tried to go back to vanilla js and use npm but it didnt work as it seems like module bundlers are still necessary to bundle external packages from node, but esm modules allow for only inbuilt modules like split file, which I guess does kinda make sense!! Thennnn, i went to lunch expecting to be alone, but josephine was there! And even though I didnt want to talk to anyone cause I was getting over cast y, talking with her kinda made me feel better, I laughed which gave me happy hormones, so laughing is the cure to all that ails the soul loll. Then for le piece de resistance, prolly used that wrong, but before that, i then did some.physics homework. I made some good progress and right now, i have about 3 questions left. I should be able to finsih them tomorrow. WISH ME LUCK 😭, I dont need luck really just patience and the grace of God. ..Then went to database class and at first I also started to feel bummed out because I wasnt understanding anything, and ethan got it, I didnt think much of it cause I know ethan smart, then andre got it and I thought he did the highlight thingy. Which is kinda messed up of me 😭, I have to stop trying to put others down to bring myself up, but recognizing I'm doing it is a good step that allows me to stop myself when its happening next time. But yeah the class then continued pretty nicely! I'm gonna take a look at the lectures again and play with sqlite tomorrow. Hmmm. I need to start using my todolist again. ..After that, we talked to dr mina about our project and she gave us ideas about the different types of projects we can do, she told us about a research project with u of m involving brain tumors and segmentation, seems interesting and helpful but as you know that I know that I cant do that :(, lifes too short to worry about things like that, same with status. Lastly she gave us ideas on a reimbursement project, which looks quite complex, but that never stopped me, actually yes it has, cough cough socket.io 😭😭, I'm thinking of giving up on that loll, but the reimbursement is looking pretty nice. Supernatural delivered my grips and I'm omw home now. I was still feeling a bit overcasty but being faced with a new challenge kinda gave me a weird sort of excited motivation, same with running walking to reach the car LOL, I was already planning on doing cardio to calm down, so I guess now I can do supernatural with my new grips! ..Now I'm headed home, tomorrow we have linear algebra and mobile app development, I was compiling the ideas for the app i want to make, one that uses blinking for morse code, but another that I like is an app where I can use checkpoints to get someone to navigate through the university and lead them around different buildings, idk if theres already sth like it but who cares, gonna start designing it, I already have a few ideas!!!! ..Actually that might be the idea I'd pick. I also want to use autohotkey to automatically connect to my VPN once I'm at school and disconnect when I'm home, wow 😭😭 I have quite a few projects I wanna get into ..First was gren.Then the database project .Then the OEE project .Soon the Children association tests project .Then mobile app dev project..For Oee project, the complexity will mostly come from trying to get websocket to work. Right now, I'm thinking of just doing continuous api calls, but I just wanna use some new technology 😭😭😭😭😭,..I also got overwhelmed with technologies like Express.js, like what the heck is Express, how do people use it, it.seems like it's a node is framework, where I can have a server on the backend with it, and I guess use it for apis and validation and stuff. Backend is pretty complex tbh! New challenges Ara, you got bored with front end, now you're throwing yourself headfirst into new technologies, I know you can do it tho  and if yoj cant figure it out, you'll find a way to make it happen :salutes:..Also my nitro runs out tomorrow eeee

    Entry: I finished lin alg's homework!! I didn't know how to solve a problem but I tried and solved it, how cool!!!!! So now I just need to suffer with physics homework 😭, wish me luck. Other than that, today has been a lazy day. It snowed today, and I want to buy Nigerian clothes. Now I'm brushing my teeth. Wow I ate a lot today XD ..I'll see you tomorrow guy..O and I want to make a basic project in golang with websockt ,I'll try harder tomorrow. And this time, I'm not giving up. I'm telling you!!

    Entry: Hey hello, today has been a normal day, I played echo vr and roblox, had the coding club meeting and connect API mocker finally works!! ..Something interesting happend today, when I was bringing the groceries home, an unknown guy asked me if I played soccer, and I said no of course I did, but I did, and he looked really familiar! But yeah loll, I did some questions on lin alg's homework, and I'll try to finish it tomorrow so I can focus on physics homework. Hmmm, I did the kotlin homework, and I finished wonder egg. ..Oh oh something else interesting happend today, two guys in a red and blue car were making donuts outside here, very surprising. I'm really hungry now, and I don't feel like brushing my teeth, but I know I need to do it to keep my teeth clean uhh, I see you..AkSO ugh I've been thinking of getting into AI, ugh I dont even know, it's all pointless to try to worry about things like this, like chasing the wind, I'll see you

    Entry: I feel much better, after my last post, I did more cardio with the treadmill until my dad came, he cleared my head. And when I got home, I found a way to do the mock API in a very easy way. After that I watched more episodes of wonder egg priority, and tomorrow. After the call with the coding club. I will do the MAD homework, and then, I will choose when the time comes, but I will decide between lin alg and physics, both subjects are frustrating, but I will survive as always ..o O and today is my second year playing Sky!!

    Entry: I feel.wholly unproductive.today, spent a good chunk of the day in the library, I had to reinstall ubuntu because it was acting weird, it's still having the same.issue, with the error at tje beginning, but hopefully it'll keep.working. i didnt make any progress on the OEE dashboard, the mock api thingy wasn't working as expected , so I decided to go to tdr, get a notebook and start on physics, gotta get myself.productive no? ..But I did the lectures, not so much the videos, and sid the questions, then to the homework and the questions are just out of this world. Absolutely dont correlate to what we jsut learned and I spent a good hour to 2 only to make.50 percent progress, its still progress, but like, is it really?, then I havent dont any linear algebra cause I'm pretty scared of it, I wasnt.paying attention much so I dont understand vectors, it's due next week though so I know I have time, I just don't like the feeling of not knowing what I'm doing. Then yeah the library just closed down, I'm having feelings Iof overcast so I just entered the fitness center to do some cardio and clear my mind by journaling here. ..If theres something to take away, it's that I definitely need to redefine my definition of productivity and not shape my day around it, before I used to center my day on how I ate, and now I don't think about it as much. Bjt I dont want to replace it with how productive I was, even though I do know that given my current mindset, if I have a super productive day, I'd be super happy, right now I'll just silence my head with cardio..Also I'm still watching wonder egg priority and it's a 10/10, well 9.5/10 anime!

And now, I need to add 30lbs on both sides to reach 315lbs!! I know I can do it. ..I'm watching the mha movie right now and it's awesome! I've been trying to make the mock api with javascript but it's not working ;-;. I'm going to sleep now

    Entry: I was pretty productive today, I reached 1700 elo in chess, and I had dinner with Andre Michael and Ethan. I have to buy a textbook for physics ;-; , and I talked to Ben about our goals and stuff like that, I don't have much to talk about, my little brother fought with my mother because she found out he had rings, very entertaining yes, now I'm going to read the bible, see you..I also relaxed on sky, visiting maps of my favorite seasons

    Entry: Wow, two happy days!!! I know!! I just finished my app dev class, and I'm heading home, I can say that my worries from last week were useless, well, I guess not, and I guess I didn't spend much time thinking about it, but I think today, the class went really well and I had fun with my normal friends :D, I had a meeting with andy and we talked about my longing for authority and why I don't want to tell things to my parents, I think the session helped me at least a little bit..I talked to daniel more and we decided that we're going to stick with vue 2, at least until bootstrap makes sense and gives us support for vue 3! It's raining here, or is it raining, and I like the environment, I downloaded linux and when I get home, I'll configure it more, hmm I got a cramp again!! And very strong 😭, I can still feel it, and I'm afraid to move my legs, healthy healthy frog tail, Mohammed invited me to play soccer, but I couldn't because of the cramp :*(. I like that now, I have more confidence in myself and my code, I can understand more things without many problems, and it doesn't fill me with terror xD. ..Now I'm hungry xD, I'll talk to you tomorrow, or later today

    Entry: I feel amazing!! And very productive, I sent an email to dr qian and dr Carmona, started working on the OEE project, and spent the whole day trying to switch the codebase to vite and vue 3 instead of vue cli, at first, I thought it would be relatively easy, but then, I realized that I needed to change bootstrap as well, and that comes with its problems, and then webpack, and finally I found out that I couldn't continue using vue cli, so I switched it to vite, and now it works, but there is one little problem, the site takes a long time to load? At first. But then it's very fast, tomorrow I'll try to find out why it does that, I'll compare it with another vite project and see the differences..My new headphones and ssd also came, and the ssd works!! How exciting! Tomorrow I'm also downloading linux!! I have my flashdrive and all that, so, I hope everything will be very easy. I have, I think two classes tomorrow, I don't know if I have a lab, I doubt it, but we'll see. Hmm, tomorrow I'm going to destroy my body in the gym as usual! And now I have two headphones haha, so I can separate myself from the world. I haven't read today, but I have a good excuse :(, I worked out. Les mills, very very brutal. Ehh, yeah, I think that's it, I was very productive and started and have made a lot of progress on the oee project. ..Tomorrow I will continue my streak of happiness woop wooopp, I'm happy that I sent an email to dr Carmona, and dr qian. Also the new season of sky started today!!

    Entry: I've finished the linear algebra homework!! Woop woop, ethan helped me! He can see the results of the homework I took when I took the class, he helped me a lot, I also bought a ssd, a sd card reader because I wanted to setup hoemassistant on the pi top, and it worked!! But I wasn't really excited about it because I wanted to do it on my server and I don't want to have another device, especially since I need to find another charger to use it, so I'm not going to use it, and for now, I'll use the server with nextcloud to store my files, and it works great. Maybe in the future, when I play more with the server, I'll find more things I can use it with, oh, I wonder if I can "host", serve? The discord bot there, maybe, if I use a virtual machine. It's possible, maybe I'll try. ..Changing the subject, tomorrow I don't have classes, so I'll do les mills for exercise, and continue with my daily routine. But now, I have the OEE project. I already have the resources to start and I will start tomorrow, I will also email dr qian!! I have to do it, and I will do the same with dr Carmona, but now I want to do a study with dr hill. I will see how it goes...Hmmmm., that more than more than more, I started watching cowboy bebop and I like it, I also love watching mha animation, and I want the show to be successful. Hmmmmmmmmm, I played a lot of chess games, I guess I'll see you tomorrow

    Entry: It's been pretty productive. I attended the scp call, but left before the call ended and I should have met up, but I didn't, and I explained why, well, one version of reality :*), daniel gave me my dbrand skin, and we're finally going to start the new project!! We're a real team!! Man that's awesome, he was using vue 2 so I don't know if I want to tell him I want to upgrade, I'll think about it and tell you later, but right now I have a pretty easy assignment, but first, I need to focus on my linear algebra homework, it's 4 days away, and hopefully, I forgot, I don't have to go to school on Monday, so I can finish it then too, but I want to finish it tomorrow so I don't have to think about it. ..Hm, I ate a lot at Daniel's house, and I want to say something, or rather, I was thinking something, I don't like hedonic adaptation, I don't want to spend my days thinking and wanting something, and when I achieve it, I feel sad because I don't have something to look forward to anymore. I want to enjoy, if not every day, then at least every experience that I must, ugh I want to be able to enjoy experiences that made me happy in the past, like seeing a dark eyed junco or a tufted titmouse! But after all is said and done, there's usually still a feeling of emptiness and lack of direction;-;, guess its life tho, and life goes on. But on the positive aspects, I got my Dbrand skin!! And new hard drives!

I didnt even know 😭, we already know what we are gonna do tomorrow wink wink, lol gonna try to hop on the call with the router acting up trash excuse, I cant keep putting off going to daniels😭😭, unless something comes up for him, which is not impossible...Cant wait to get the ball rolling, also started working on my redesign of gren, I feel less intimidated by the children association tests, but theres still an irking there, imma email dr qian this week, well, eventually, same with dr carmona :*). My legs still hurt like a bum! Tmj is so annoying!!! Hmm what else. Ahora estoy rumbo a casa, y continuaré el book thief, cuando comencé ese libro, no se porque no me gustaba! Es interesante y me gusta la historia. Todavia estoy haciendo lecciones de italiano en luodingo, y no tengo escuela el martes. Hmm para sertehonesto, no puedo pensar en mucho más que decir, me desperté muy mal, pero durante el curso del día, me.sentia mejor, estaba productivo, y he mejorado mi entendimiento? Understanding of myself. Cuando tiendo a ignorar a alguien, usualmente tengo miedo a ellos, el. mismo occurio con noah. Pues cambiando el tema,  es bueno que todavía no hayan abierto física, no tengo que preocuparme en eso. Pero ahora no hay muchas cosas. Pues en realidad, hay pocas cosas que me preocupan, y me gusta esa sensación, caminando en el nieve después de hacer ejercicio, con mis piernas sufriendo en dolor xD,  la buena vida te digo!..Tsmbien yo en el furuto, you got to watch mother Simpson again, yeah you know, the episode that makes you tear up loll, its such a good episode

We were trash, but I had fun, AND CRAMPED SO MUCH LOLL, HAD TO EAT THE TANGERINE IN MY BAG. From now on while eating a tdr,I need to get in more micronutrients, no ice cream, and I'm kinda bummed about my cardio, I think I was able to hold up.for a while, but I couldn't really, I had explosive power in my.legs and was able to jump pretty high, which is cool lol. But at first I was super bummed out with my cardio, and I wanna sign up for soccer, or futsal - indoor soccer. It's pretty late though, so we'll see. We'll see....We also had chess club and I beat andre and evan twice, it was pretty fun. But yeah, from now on, I got to work on my explosive cardio 😭😭, I thought les mills was helping me LOL, actually I can say that les mills is helping me and I'm gonna keep doing it. After I get my grip from supernatural, imma be getting that cardio in, idk if I should move my program to four days, hmm I'll think about it...Tomorrow I dont even have to go on campus!! Also leg day was fun and challenging, I have physics, which hasnt even being opened yet. Geez I smell

    Entry: I feel happy, more productive than before at least, tomorrow I'm going to the gym with seed and I can't wait to see what we're going to do. I started the book the book thief again, and this time. I don't hate it. I tell you the truth XD, I wonder how many days it will take me to finish the book. But in other news, I decided to redo and redesign my project :*), also when I think about dr qian's site, I get that feeling like before of worry and it makes me feel overwhelmed. ..Maybe I'll take time tomorrow trying to clean up the code, but also I don't want to break anything, everything is very delicate now, but I think if I still want to enjoy my life XD, I should find a way to make the code faster, cleaner and all that. I watched some videos in the go course, and I'm learning cost functions, or fnes which is used to determine how good the best fit line is, my grammar is horrible LOL, but yeah there is a formula and all that, I don't have mobile app dev class tomorrow, and I want my group to work on a database that we can use to schedule rooms for teaching and stuff, it will be a wonderful idea and very useful but lets see..I also tried to setup home assistsnt again, but since I haven't enabled hypervisors because I can't access the bios, I tried to make something called guacamole, but it didn't work, as usual. My back also hurts...as usual...So, I played beat saber, listened to music, and bought new headphones..O also noticed something, and side note. Justin took two pictures of me, I saw him when I was walking to the library. That's just something out of the ordinary that I wanted to say xD, but I think my appetite has reduced a lot, I can't eat as much as before, or maybe it's just in my head, I don't know, see you tomorrow

    Entry: Now I feel better but it still bothers me, my brain bothers me ;-; I hate these human feelings, the feeling of envy, hatred (or something like that), fear of failure or inexplicable sadness, all these feelings, and I can't understand or manage them, but at least writing here calms me down and relaxes me. It makes me feel like the world is not going to end because I felt out of place in a 16 week class lol. ..Speaking of which. Tomorrow I will email dr Carmona to see what will happen with the google earth engine practice. I have, many, many hours until the database, from 8 am to 3 pm, 7 hours, SEVEN HOURS, so, I will work on my site, I can't use my virtual machine, so I guess I can do it in my normal browser? I will try to make a new routine, I wake up, I take a shower, I listen to Italian lessons on language transfer, then I do some exercise, I will go to eat or to the library, when I am in the library, I will start with the golang course, then with ml, after that maybe I will play with android studio, I can also work on my project, I was working on dr qian's site, and my code has become very complex aaa, I am afraid of finding programming errors!! It terrifies me!! Because that will also mean that maybe, I can't find the bug. Like the one from last semester, or that will mean that I have to rewrite many lines of code!! ..I also want to talk about my problems to other people, real people, and the first person I want to talk to is ben, but really, I don't know, he's a little weird😭, and he usually doesn't answer very fast, so I don't know, I don't know

And we were talking about frameworks and stuff.like.that , he works for the border thingy, ugh I wish I could get a real job AAAA , but still, I guess God planted that guy there to boost my mood or something, but I really felt comfortable, or at least, he made me happy because I could talk about things that excite me, like in sunny side vue but face to face!! And it made me think that yes! I don't know all the information in the world, but I do understand what I understand, and I shouldn't base my knowledge or my happiness on what other people think of me, so cliché but so true!!

    Entry: Actualmente no sé cómo me siento, acabo de terminar mi clase de Mobile app development, y me gusta godfrey, no es un profesor estricto o algo así.  Pero no sé, no me cae muy muy bien. Tengo dos hipótesis, mi primer hipótesis es que dado que no sabía si la clase era en línea o cara a cara, entonces that put me in a situation where I was disillusioned essentially about the class, so I was first meh to the class, then kind of excited about it, then seeing that the class was face to face kinda pendulumed me. I really enjoyed physics lab with jezelle, andre and carlos, its gonna be a fun class with them...For mobile development, my brother is not in the class, something that kind of comforts me more than it should, ugh,now I'm alone in the quiet library on a rocking chair and I looked behind me and thought I saw a girl, got a mini heart attack loll, but yeah the professor looks.pretty good, so my first hypothesis is that walking into the unfamiliar made me feel out of place, ben and ethan also weren't able to attend the class so I used my computer to call and projext it to them LOL ..Then my second hypothesis, kind of going back on the feeling out of place thing, is that I didnt really know where I fell in the hierarchy of power, sounds weird, but it's true, there are people there like Logan and the other dude who have had more experience with java probably, and we are all using this new technology that kind of doesnt apply or crossover well to the technologies we have previously learned. More so,  this was probably mostly in my head, but I felt like Godfrey was looking over me, like not making much eye contact which is a weird thing to cherry pick and worry about lol,.but usually in my classes, I'm usually surrounded by people I know and can be comfortable with, but in this class, even though these people are present, it kind of seems like a class where I'll be a normie, just like everyone else learning a new technology and not standing out to like godfrey or something, ..But then what do I do about these two hypothesis, well. I'm going to have a lot of time to ruminate over it since I don't have class next week monday and the lecture will be recorded on thursday, but for feeling out of place, especially since its in a different room than my typical computer science classes, I'll be back to my normal self overtime. And I'm 100 percent sure that its notnl something that'll continuously bug me, now I can have interactions with people and godfrey. He makes jokes and reciprocates them. So that's pretty cool, I'll give it time. I'll be much more comfortable being around them ..For the second one and the weirdly sounding superiority complex, also side note. Another thing coulve been that I wss just worried about farting LOL, just did it now  in the empty echoey library, random note,some dude or professor walked into the bathroom ws I was peeing and then he essentially.peed like baby chris did in the family guy episode about the valentines dude. And he farted...loudly LOL, I was thinking about whether he was some secret agent  or something and doing that woild mean that I would be too awkward to look at him so he could hide his identity, my mind goes to crazy places LOL...But going back to the main issue. I want to say that its okay to be normal and just be one of the noobs essentially ,but I dont think thatd make me feel much more better? I like standing out granted, and helping people to maybe make me feel better about myself..Another side note ugh, I led cru today and it was funny! They had Bucharest. Back to the matter nahhh. ..But over time, i think it's the same thing of giving things time. I'm a bit overwhelmed and already kinda brain blocked on the project ideas for my.final presentation, I know I want to do something big, but i have a sufficient amount of time to think of a project, I've done it numerous times in the past, and I'll be able to do it now. Over time I'll be able to assimilate to my new role. Which is what I was going to say but I didnt get a sense of relief. More like a sense of more dread loll. Ugh I guess I have to subscribe to the age old idea that if I'm the smartest person in a room, I guess apart from the professor, I should go to another room, which is kinda what would be happening here, I'm getting introduced to annew piece of software like others in the classroom, and I wouldn't know all the answers, and I should and will work towards being okay and comfortable with not knowing all the answers. I'll be able to pick up on nolan's teaching style pretty quickly, he talks about real world scenarios and things you can relate to, and as it relates to my role in the class, give it time, I'm learning and it's a college class like any other, if you're not learning something new, then what's the point. Woah this was quite the long journal lol...In more.mundane news, lifted today and did deadlifts!! I'm still able to do 225 with minimum back sufferi ng XD, I worked more on my project, not a ton more, but it was pretty cool, sunny side vue has been active.lately, ...Linear algebra was just TERRIBLE,dr zhong seems like a nice enough lady, but her teaching style is horrible,I had to teach myself already and it's just the first day, luckily we dont have as much assignments as with calc 2 so I dont have to worry about the pre class work, I'll look ahead into the excel sheet a bit more tonight slash tomorrow and watch youtube videos to practice the concepts. ..Cory from the anime club just walked in LOL. I'll talk to you later tho, I feel a bit better about the MAD, lol the what's the word, abbreviation is MAD, I'll sit a chair back just to not be as close to him as I was loll, but I'll. Be alright, ill keep learning with others, if I'm put in a situation where I need to swallow my pride and ask for help, or see others get help from other people. Then swallow it I shall, which sounds weird yes loll. See you

    Entry: Okay i didn't do much else, but i wanted to ask ben how he feels happy when other people are successful, but i didn't ask him because i'm a chicken ;;-;, maybe i will ask him in the future. ..In the database class, we have to come up with - i like this word - an idea, but i think the correct thing is to come up with an idea, where we work with the school or a business to design a database for them. It's pretty interesting, and we want to do it with dr Carmona, but we also want to do something big, right now, i don't have any idea what we're going to do, but i know that eventually, i will come up with an idea.

    Entry: I had a lot of fun today, laughed a lot in database class, spent many hours in andre's dorm, and ive started working on my gren project. I dont know if dr qian will email me, Ill wait for it. Also after many weeks, I was able to lift weights again, I lifted 195 for 5 reps on the incline, but 225 felt too heavy, I think its because I did inclines first, but let's see, I cant wait to do it again tomorrow, ..Pisewisgeon watched cyberpunk!! How funny and crazy xD, he recommended me some songs, and I added free bird with rock lobster to my playlist. In physics class, we dont have face to face classes. So I dont need to rush when I'm working out. Also something weird happened. I was looking at ben in ds class and we spent like two or more seconds looking at each other, and I couldnt stop looking at him. It felt so so strange, I need to reset my brain xD..Well, we're home now, I'll talk to you later

    Entry: Pretty normal day, played supernatural, did three routines, a meditation and stretching session because I thought we had to do five exercises or routines, but noOOO, it's five days! So there are four left :*), ..I have a weird screenshot xD, ben and andre were talking about stuff, and I don't know how I feel about it, it's just that, at least I imagined it, but I didn't know it, but now I know, and well, I don't know why I care so much, he's being honest, and I'm nobody to judge, especially since I can't be honest with myself either, honest and open, hiding things is very exhausting. ..My parents just got back from a party or something, school starts tomorrow, well, I only have two classes and five hours of break between the two. I can finally go to the gym!!!! ..Or I started a new project, it's called gren, and it's an ecommerce site. I'm using vue and typescript, today I had one of those overwhelming moments, where I see again that there are so many things I don't understand!!! So many things, but always, I know I need to relax, focus on the things I know, and learn things organically, ay I'm looking at the ss rn and cringing so hard 😭😭 , in better news, I have a 1000 day streak on luodingo woooopqooo, of course, I will continue my streak, I want to keep learning italian, although my progress is quite slow..O and I started and finished akudama drive, I stopped watching mirai nikki - future diary, at first I loved the anime, but now I don't like the characters, yada by yadda, I found another isekai anime but it has a very long name,

How cool. O and I tried openvpn with my computer at school, and it worked!! So now I can connect to my network from anywhere!!! ..Seeing so many people come for the frc kickoff brought back memories, but I'll leave those in the past, or for another day, I talked to dr hill about ben, and I hope he can help you. Also physics will be online too!! This semester is a mess 😭😭, at this point, I only have maybe one face to face class ;-;. I've been designing the ecommerce site I want to make, I don't like the go course, it doesn't explain anything at all, but I guess I have to study this myself, so I need to find more online resources to do it. But I have a bit of good news, dr bani taan. Although he told me that I can't audit a class, he said that he can invite me to some classes, and he'll send me an email, I'll see how it goes. .. And I found another really good anime, it's called future diary!

But let's see, I cleaned out my backpack, and this morning, I made a chicken and pineapple dish, I used soy sauce but I hated the taste, so I added worcester sauce and I think I saved it. ..Next week, I have the scp meeting, but I'm not going, or at least, I will, but at daniel's house and I won't pay attention. I finished akiba maid, I don't know how I feel about it, but I loved it. Hmm, today is the last day of study of film, :*), I loved the class, and I had a lot of fun, but now. I have to go back to normal school ;-;, can you believe it, I'm still doing htb xD, and I'm learning new things, ..I was talking to ben, he feels very frustrated because he didn't get the results he wanted - talking about the companies he applied to. He didn't get an offer from Fanuc and he told me that things at home weren't going well, so he might have to get a job;-; He feels very frustrated, and I understand that, but at the end of the day, only he can define or control his destiny.

I have to talk to dr mina about it :*), but yes,, on Saturday I'm going to school, wish me luck. What's more, good news, I got a grade of 80/80 on my presentation, how cool. ..I also played rumble with Ethan, had fun :D, my younger brother is watching sonny boy, and it reminded me why I want and love that show, the soundtrack, episode 4 with the monkeys oh, there's no anime that has made me feel like this. I ate a lot of ice cream too, and I'm really sore, oh it's so late, I woke up late today, and I want to sleep earlier aa, see you

I want to read the bible more, recently it's been harder for me to do so, but it's just something I need to reincorporate into my routine. ...Ehhh, what am I saying that I haven't told you already, I'm still enjoying pero like's videos, my younger brother is watching mha, and I think he likes it.

Tonight, I'll let you know, and I need to calm down, my parents are not going to tell me no, yes, I'll probably be uncomfortable, but I need to get out of my comfort zone, it only takes three ish hours, ..I kinda want to say this in english aaa, what's the worst that could happen, the students aren't interested, fine I guess, my brothers also there?

    Entry: Although I didn't do anything exceptional today I did have a lot of fun, I played beat saber with Ethan and found vr games on roblox, and the game I played with my brother was on there and it scared me so so much. Tomorrow I have to do a presentation for the film class, wish me luck, I already have my questions, and I hope everyone talks, I hope so!!! ...I've been watching a lot of pero like videos, and I love the feeling of finding a new youtube channel, and being able to discover a part of the internet I didn't know about before. I did yoga too! And I learned more about AI, I emailed dr bani taan asking if I can audit his class, I hope he says yes. I think I need to email Q. From acceleratekids. But I don't want to, I think I'll tell him that I'll wait until I have a car, and then I'll work with it, I don't feel like doing many things now, I don't feel like being lazy anymore, and I don't have the feeling of laziness that I had before - when I thought I was running away or didn't want to do new things, but now I'm comfortable with learning new things without having to earn money, or teach children, or work!!! ..Yes sometimes I feel bored, but I think that now, I have many things to do, and although from time to time, I am lazy, it is a balance that I don't want to break. Now I'm going to take a shower because playing beat saber with Ethan exhausted me, but I like that it did. now we can play together, and he can improve his skills..I also had a lot of fun in today's class, now we're talking about get out, and tomorrow my presentation will come first, so, well, I'm not going to worry or think about those things anymore, inhale, well, no because this bathroom smells like shit :*), I want to train my AI to understand me and I don't know if I'm destroying the data with my platitudes 🤣

I'm still doing hsckthebox. It's harder because i don't have enough cubes. So i can't do much ;-;, maybe i'll buy some cubes. I played sky with nyny and sarah, and this time, i wasn't scared, maybe i think too much and that stops me from having fun or making more friends, now i'm going to sleep, or i made contact lenses and did some exercise, it was brutal!!

My parents went to a party, and I was lazy during that time, I watched some episodes of spy x family, I practiced a little with golang, and I started another new anime called Akiba maid or something like that, it's very brutal, today is the first day of the new year, I hope God guides me during this new year, and I hope to have new experiences, grow more in my knowledge and my talent to learn new things, I hope to get more fit!! Like a tank!!!! And very soon, in nine months, which now that I say it, esp is a long time. But in nine months, I'll be 18, I don't know why I'm so worried, I'll still be the same person.

Or something like that, it didn't help me, i chatted with a guy but i guess he was chatting with some other people, so i left him. i wanted to talk to him about my jealousy problem, but i didn't find any new information ;-;, so i guess i'll fight with myself, i don't feel like doing something good lol, like reading or watching a video on go course, or even chatting with gpt chat, now i'm a potato i guess, ah what do i do, i'm hungry lol.

We don't have a final exam in my film class anymore!!!! So exciting, I attended another aurora concert but I didn't finish it because I had to eat :(, maybe I can ask chat gpt if he can give me some tips to improve the distinction between the subjunctive and the preterite. ..See you later, I'm thinking about sleeping before the new year, I've already done my reflection, but I can add some goals I have for the new year ..GOALS WHICH I WILL PROBABLY FORGET BUT AT LEAST I PUT THEM HERE..- improve my Italian, yes, maybe I will study Greek less, but I want to be able to talk more with nyny, and I have to wish nyny a great new year!! I don't know if sky has the event now, I doubt it, but it's possible, I see it after writing here..- put on more muscles, it's obvious no? ..- learn new things as you know, i want to learn more about golang and use it, maybe also use it for AI, i'll keep working with dr qian and maybe learn react, let's see xD, well, maybe svelte more than react ..- develop new relationships, basic stuff like that ugh..I'm not the kind of person who does stuff like that, at the beginning of my journaling journey, yes, but now i've realized that life is complicated and has many, many surprises, the new year, i'll be eighteen, and now i'm still pretty young, or at least i consider myself young, but there's no need to worry about stuff like that, ...The new year will bring many things, and we'll face them together!!

    Entry: Nothing exciting happened today, im kinda tired of saying the same thing so i guess i'll try to think of something else to talk about, i've been wanting to talk to ben alone for a few days now, and well we're talking about our new years resolutions. He wants to be able to lift 315 pesos on the bp next year. It's pretty late now, and i want to sleep a little bit more, i usually wake up a little tired but i get used to it pretty quickly. ..i want to setup home assistsnt but it seems like they've stopped supporting the plugin so i need to find another way to download it, i'm going to sleep now, ..Edit: now i have something to say, i don't know how to explain it but ahhhh every time i want to talk about him when its about something weird or strange i feel so ahhh, lately, i've been wanting to talk to ben a lot and when im not talking to him, i want to!! I don't know aaah, maybe I get some sick rush from knowing that I'm talking to someone who maybe looks up to me and wants to keep the conversation going 😭, or I know that I can always turn the conversation in a way that makes me feel better about myself, but I think I'm just thinking bad and rude things/explanations :( but maybe it's the truth? ..Side note, I don't know if I said this here but I want to create an AI that I can use to chat with myself with the information in this app and it will be awesome to create something like that, if someone has a lot of information about themselves. They can create their own character and talk to them .that will be awesome. Or so I think, maybe that will be my goal for my senior year of college, ..But changing the subject back to Ben's thing, I think that's the simple explanation? I don't know, maybe I just enjoy his presence because we're friends? Like with Ethan

    Entry: I feel a lot better now :D, I can still feel that feeling, but it's less now, and I can face it without worry now, or so I hope :*), I can't wait for class tomorrow. I've already seen the movies and today I saw guess who's coming to dinner, I don't hate it, it's an interesting movie. The actors are really good. ..I'm in the bathroom right now xD, and I don't know what to talk about, hmm. Maybe I'll do a recap of this year, since I can do it right now and here, but I don't know if I can write it in Spanish, I don't want to diminish my thoughts. Are we? ...Sit down because this is going to be really long, or maybe not :*) ..This year honestly didnt feel super long, and I feel pretty old now that I'm approaching 18 years old :*), also I dont fully remember all the big changes this year. But that's what I have you for, and I think I'll do a quick run through how I've grown, and how I've not grown :(..First, the one thing that comes to mind are the skills I'm learning/currently picking up, I started this year wanting to learn more about the composition api, do more work for dr qian, and work about I did!! Learn nuxt and vite and concept like module bundoers and package managers, I wanted to be better at cooking and make some new creations . I also wanted to be more philosophical during the summer loll, woah that feels like a while away!! My spanish!! I started journaling in spanish. And consuming a lot more Spanish content, from music with my spotify wrapped being alternative latin? And youtubers like Jenny lorenzo loll. ..Also started listening to Spanish podcasts to workout , and I finsihed I think about 12 books, finishing an entire 900+ page spanish book!! Like that's a lot to be proud of, I reached a 225 squat, bench and deadlift, I got a vr and worked and am currently working on improving my cardio and boxing technique, I made new friends like vex, and still have old ones that I still kinda fear talking to like nyny, il talk more about that, and cool ones like Hansel. I deepened my relationship with Ben and the others in class, and explored deeply, and still exploring my relationship and reaction with Andre. I watched new animes like.blue lock, chainsawman, I finished the berserk manga and caught up on the mha and black clover's, I got a new laptop and the simpsons had a death note parody! I started off the summer break in such an airy mood. A solid routine and a light heart, I met peope like jasmine, sarah, zuri and lahnihya in our JOURNI summeer.program that made life during that time amazing...I made money, I lost money. I furthered my relationship with God, and I stumble over that because I still don't feel really right saying that witb how I am right now. But I read the entire new testament, or the entire bible, I don't remember, but still!! ..I should've contacted ms Yates and ms Johnson and Fisher more, but that's alright, I took on new scary challenges like the meeting with the skillman foundation, ooh I still feel the chills, I worked on my lucid dreming skills, something I'm still planning on working on, and I wonder if I will ever take lsd, LOL that's a weird thing to say! I continued learning Italian and even started Greek, I only know the very basics of both so far, but it's a start I'm hoping to continue. Hmmm, I downloaded minutiae, I went outside in the snow to collect samples like a real biologist, one of my dreams, it snowed on Christmas!! I got a letter from the vice president and panicked about whether I should post it on LinkedIn or not, I MADE MY FIRST.POST ON LINKEDIN THIS YEAR!!..I got invited to present my project by dr bani taan, and I got all As this semester! I WENT TO A JEWISH SYANGOGUE AND I DRESSED UP AS A MAID!!! I passed dr grabowski class. Woo so much happened!! And I feel like I'm still missing a lot more, if I go back, I'll be sure to find so much more. I had to explore deeper parts of my relationship with other people, like in the yoga room with Casey which was the first time I imagined myself in a relationship with another person, or my short fantasies with you know who LOLL, aaaa I became friends, not really, acquaintances! With the doubt that I said I wanted to cause I liked how he walked around the gym, not by choice but still!! And I was able to get to know Raphael, I learned more about java! And I set up a home server and learned more/am currently learning more about databases and hacking hehehe, I ALSO GOT INTO SKY BETA AND TESTED THE AURORA CONCERT AAA still without a lot, and God is now usually an after thought, which is usually what happens after cru ends for the school year, it's something I'll have to continually work on. More so, even though I love my physique, my eating h as been less than ideal and I think my body is very forgiving XD, like honestly!!! Its so forgiving. Wow I'm calling my body more forgiving than I'm giving God credit for forgiving my sins 😭😭  but yeah! Even after the Christmas day eatings, I could still see my abs! Maybe the lighting is justmarvelous, it's not really overhead, more like at a reverse 45 degrees or a 135 degrees? Angle xD but still!! I got stronger on my lifts, nope, this is just the negatives ara!! I kept sissing out of leg day because of my trash deadlifting form, my oral hygiene has been pretty trash lately, and my relationship with my older brother LOLL. I say as I punched him mistakenly though yesterday XD. I didnt bake as much as I would like, and there are other things I wish I could have learned, ..Sometimes,rarely, but sometimes when I see the popularity of react, I regret learning vue. Just sometimes tho! Very very little times. My relationship with a few friends have been questionable on my part because of my jealousy or envy problem? Sometimes it doesnt seem like that anymore but maybe that's the root of it all? I dont know mann. Joy left udm, mr lanre died :(, forgot about that, twitter is going to poop, and I didnt talk to giraffe or find savvy all year LOL, I couldn't achieve a full lucid dream, and lately like I told you before, I feel like I've been chickening out of opportunities that could be good for me, something I'm making an active effort to change!! ..All in all, I think the goods outweigh the bad, maybe I'm just making myself not see how horrible I've been loll, but all in all, I'm happy with how the year went, next year, my goals stay prett much the same, keep an open mind and try new stuff, always be learning new things,dont let your curiosity die, and be happy in general okey?..I believe in you!!

    My mood Conflicted
    
    Entry: Tengo que confesar que me siento un poco, pues muy muy conflictivo, hace poco, no he querido enfrentar retos nuevos cuando se trata del trabajo. No quiero hacer programas o cositas así, por ejemplo, creo que ya sabes esto, but jelani sent some opportunity thing with acceleratekids, and when I signed up for it, I didnt think soo much about it, now I'm having the same feeling j had with the skillman foundation, idk if it's just general burnout from so manyexperiences, but i dont even do that much.. ..I think my brothers doing the same thing I'm doing, maybe this is just fear I'm feeling ? Geez I need a therapist, but for now. I'll imagine that I'm talking to one..So far, I've done different programs, signed up for the CS ed week hero thing, and that night where I had to go to the skillman meeting by myself, idk maybe it was really stressful, it kinda was, and maybe ths feelingim getting is an extension of that feeling, I feel it in my chest like a weight, a dull ish weight, telling me that either I shouldnt do it, or trying to simulate the stress I would feel from doing it, but at this point, I think it's all really fear to be hones. And I might be interpreting it SO WRONG, but I think it's the fear of commitment, the fear of failure, fear and inhibitions holding me back, I dont feel the same way about the summer program with dr Carmona. And I dont feel the same way bout learning htb and go, speaking of which I got to watch the courses tonight. I dont feel the same way about learning new languages, or trying new food LOL. Even though trying new food can sometimes be hard XD. I dont feel the same way when I'm taking new projects usually, and even when I was working with dr qian and started, this is a very unique feeling to that, I can tell that much, its coool that my body can have different feelings that are distinguishable from the other, but I know that this feeling is different, and maybe I think I might be misinterpreting it, it could be fear, but I also feared failure with dr qian and so much more. I feared commitment, not really, with college LOL, or with getting into computer science..It's an entirely new feeling developing. And I think I just have to shape it to my advantage, whenever I feel that way  and i have no solid reason not to say no, then i should go for whatever i want to do! Who's gonna stop me, just go for it!! Apart from if you really dont feel like it loll, I feel the same feeling again, it's like a greener version of what i felt when i didnt want to take tbe sat then, but I survived that and I'll survive this, I worked out with les mills and played rumble, i watched guess who's coming to dinner and class today was super fun!!! The professor is hella nice, and I'm looking forward to being in the clsss

Tomorrow starts the film class :*), I hope it will be a good class, and I will have a lot of fun, I have already read all the articles and the films for next week, so I just need to do the work for the week after next week. ..I have finished the spirit labyrinth!!! And that means I have finished all the books in that series :D, that's cool, well done and congratulations to me!! That means I have to find another book, this time, something in English!! ..I played rumble more and I think I have improved a lot, so. I'm still rubbish, but I'm better than before. Now I want and need to sleep, I want to wake up early tomorrow. And I have scheduled my interview for Wednesday. ..See you!! Also this new year. I want to be even stronger and bigger. You'll see >:D..I also watched more episodes of Bobs Burger, and I hit my older brother when he was playing echo vr xD, he got really angry, but I laughed and had a lot of fun

    Entry: I feel great, I'm almost done with the labyrinth of spirits, and I LOVE it!!, I love the story, a few days ago the book bored me a little, but then, the story revealed itself and progressed very fast, and I love it. Fermin is now working on the cemetery of forgotten books, I knew it!! And Alicia left :*0, Daniel's son wants to be a writer and he knows about Julian carax, I think I'll be able to finish the book tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. ..I bought the golang course today too, and I finished a module in htb, now I'm doing the web servers one, and I can't wait, I'm also learning more about servers and data - sql and nosql, I'm learning new things day by day. I also started shane- the movie for the film studio, and I watched a few episodes of bobs burgers, and I love the show, his humor is hilarious. ..I didn't use my vr much today,

    Entry: Again with that bad nostalgia feeling. I don't know where it comes from, and I don't know why I feel it, but it's frustrating xd, I saw a video of abiola on yt and I got like this. Ehh, my back hurts again, ugh :*), ..I bought a VIP subscription on HTB because I wanted to continue learning things and it wasn't working, so I bought it, and now I can learn more and more, I just found out that the Mobile app development class is online! How disgusting, and the lectures are pre recorded(?), what, how lazy aaaa, and we're going to use git and firebase, I'm so excited, but also aaaaaa, I wanted the class to be in person, but nooOOO. ..Ouch ouch, the WiFi didn't work for maybe an hour, and I didn't know what to do! But thank goodness it started working again, my jaw still hurts, but now it's not very intense and I usually don't fix it. I played more, and i think i've improved, at least a little bit, i want to play with friends ee, i have to wait until ethan gets his vr :*). I also want to buy another phone, this time, i'm going to, i just have to find a way to destroy this piece of junk :*), i didn't care that much before, but now it's really really really slow ;-;, i want to sleep earlier today, oh i don't think my dad will, no yes, he goes to work on thursdays, i made mashed potatoes today with gravy and well. i liked it. ..I worked out today too with les mills, and hit 100 PAI :D, tomorrow i will do more yoga, maybe something for my back. See you then

    Entry: Oh I'm sleepy, I was reading a lot, today was very productive, at the beginning of the day, I tried not to use discord, and I used htb, I did Yoga!! After so many months without doing it, I read more for film study, I decided that I was not going to learn the ionic framework, but I want to learn golang and I still haven't decided if I want to buy a course. ..Daniel helped me with truenas and now it works, but I still need to approve and review it. Tomorrow I will try to do the same thing I did today, I played echo vr too

    Entry: What a productive day, except I didn't do anything ;-;, I tried setting up more stuff in truenas but nothing worked ;-;, I'll call Daniel tomorrow. Tomorrow is also the last day for the interview that I'm not going to do, and that's already decided. Hmm, I played echo vr, I played echo vr a lot. I'm a little dizzy, but I like the feeling, it's very weird and it's not very intense. Hmm, maybe I'll have a dream in echo tonight xD. I'm still doing hsckthebox, and I played les mills for exercise today, it was very intense!! I'll be very sore tomorrow :*), I'm also reading the articles for film study before class starts. I was watching chainsaw man and it's AMAZING, I love it, well I don't love it, makima is amazing and very strong

    My mood Great
    
    Entry: Man. I almost forgot to write here, I feel much much better, I posted the post on LinkedIn and left it for the world to destroy xD. Dr hill and bani taan responded! And I also now have access to gpt chat!! How cool ":D We went shopping today, I didn't buy anything, but I walked a lot, and afterwards, I had a huge headache :*). I haven't replied to skillman, but if they send me another email, I'll tell them that the position is no longer interesting to me, I've decided, and that's it! I'm not going to think about what other people think of me, I just have to think about what I want, they're not going to make the program for me, so why should I act like I owe them something? I played echo vr and it has captured my attention again!! Blue lock has inspired me and I want to play with other people and improve together. Oh, my older brother wanted to buy some soccer balls, and then he wanted to buy them too, he also wanted to buy a skateboard, but in reality, I'm not going to use it much, I don't have/will have many opportunities ;-;. So I'm not going to do it, but I want to buy a new phone with a portable display for my computer!! In short, I have to change my emotion because I'm more than happy, there were so many people outside and I felt very out of place for a few moments, but I recovered very quickly

    Entry: Now I feel better, much better, I decided to publish the letter post from kamala. But I will do it tomorrow because it is dark and I want the photo to look great xD, my decision about the skillman foundstion is the same, I will not do it.. Changing the subject, I played roblox and now I am playing more with my server, I am learning more and more about the little things, but there are soooo many things that I do not know, I do not know how many things work, but I am learning every day! Later I will learn more about dockers like daniel, right now I am not making websites, to be honest, I think this is the right time to start a project, a small but impactful and important project. I will look at my notes to see which project I want to do! But yes, I am almost done with the site for my father's friend. And dr qian has not sent me anything at all. It is unlikely that she will send an email right now. But let's see, I also want to see my notes!

    My mood bad
    
    Entry: Ugh I feel down again, today was a combo of unproductive and unmotivated, then a moment of excitement and motivation, now back to general, blech, woah I'm not ready for any responsibilities LOL. So I received a mail from the vice.president of the us kamala talking about being a cs ed week hero, and now I feel obligated to create a linkedin post or something along those lines to promote it.   More so, I've made the decision that I'm not going to interview for skillman. It's a 2 year commitment, the one thing rhat keeps holding me down, that I don't want to face, if I want to be more.pedantic. theyd want to pay. Which would mean signing a w9 form, and that's another drama that I'm not ready to go over again. So I'm going to say no, and now for this, I dont know why but I've had this aversion to posting stuff on linkedin, but it wouldnt take me long and I dont have to think too much about it LOL, I've really been running low on a) discipline,  b) motivation c) general drive to do much, or even finding something to do, rn I start my days with working on HTB, then I check emails, stay on discord for a while, look at truenas stuff, then I play vr, and then nothing really for the rest of the day, it is all most likely going to change, but the sudden halt to my every day has made me very lethargic in a sense, mentally lethargic!!! Its not overcast really, I'll use that phrase to describe it, would past me have been excited about it, I dont know, probably not, the first time I received a mail, I was like, that's pretty cool, and now the hedonic adaptation has caught up to me now I guess, it's like I'm not excited about anything, my mum is tho, so maybe I should mirror that excitement, I have the meeting with scp tomorrow, so we will see how that goes while shopping. I've been buying a lotta stuff lately so I think I have to slow down on the spendings!   All in all, I've been feeling very mentally lethargic and not wanting to get involved in things because of a fear that I wouldn't be able to do what I want. AAAAHH, and I want to talk about it with someone else but I dont want to overload ben with my brain goo loll, maybe in the fitness server, but right now, I think I'm just burnt out mentally? The last few days of schooling really did a number on me LOL, but I have a week of rest! Should I just be like, ughh I was about to nust say huck it and sign up for theinterview, then I remembered the stuff about payment and junk, this wouldnt be the first.opportunith I'll pass up, but I think it's best that I do, and I'll try not to think too hard about it, right now, FREAK WHAT THE HECK ITA ONLY 5PM GEEEEEEEEEZ, Its so dark outside oml, at this point, I'll play roblox for a while, then finish the adventures of Robin hood. Hmmm, I'll play roblox, take a picture of the thingh and post it on linkedin, idek what I fear, AAAAA maybe I should shut off my brain, no inhibitions, maybe a new start for Ara?

    Entry: I still don't know what I should do, there's a part of me that's begging me to do it, but there's another part, another big part that's telling me not to, and I don't know which one I should choose. Ahhhh I'm going to flip a coin;-;

    My mood Conflicted
    
    Entry: I'm in a dilemma, but I don't want to think too much about why I'm really lazy right now and my brain is working like a slacker xD. I got an email saying that I have an interview with the skillman foundation, and I want to tell you that I don't want to do it! I don't feel like doing it, it seems like a lot of work? It seems like a lot of work, I guess that's the same thing, but I don't want another program like SCP!! Ugh and I have to do it for two years. TWO, I don't know if I can, it's too long, they're face-to-face meetings, I have to use an Uber every time, it's once a month, and it will mean that I won't be able to attend the coding club meetings. I want to change the subject a bit, I want to do more with home automation! I really can't wait, I want to do that I can turn off the lights with my phone, but now I am still in dilemma, Now I am going to create a list of pros and cons, and see if it is something I want to do or not Pros I get to meet new people, maybe important and impactful people, I get to have a great relationship with other participants Cons I don't want to do it, this is not a detailed con, but I will try to explain more, because sometimes, many times, when I don't want to do something, and I do it, I feel happy, like when I signed up to work with dr qian, I didn't know that I will continue working with her, but here we are Pros What is the worst that could happen? I only have 12 meetings a year, a whole year!! And sometimes we'll have field trips With I won't be able to focus on other things, like learning new things, well, I don't think this is a real con, but I think it will be just one of those things that I have to do and will be on my mind and annoy me like SCP Pro They're going to pay me, and I have to make money xD, well, I don't have any, but I would like to make money With Do I have to tell my parents and do the stupid kid dance? I don’t know, you know how hard it is for me to say things to my parents, and this is going to be another thing I need to tell them ugh Pro I can get out of the house and experience new moments with other people, well, I’ve said something like that before, Con I can admit, even though I don’t want to, that I’m afraid of failure, I’ve already applied for this little thing once, and I got rejected, and I was happy ;-;, well, I didn’t care that much, but now I have an interview, and I like that it’s online, and I can choose the time that I want to do it, but I’m afraid that I’ll say something stupid, or I won’t be able to think of a satisfactory answer, but I also know that I’m going to miss all the opportunities that I don’t take, so maybe it would be better to do this, I don’t know, and I can’t know how it’s all going to go, but it will be a new experience, and maybe I need things like that. I don’t like the commitment that it will be, and it’s possible that I won’t have the chance to do things that I want to do because I have to attend their meetings, should I? I'll decide tomorrow ;-;, now I'm all a mess

And then meglovania, and then camellia's spin eterbally!! But only the modded version, not the OST. Hmm, I think we did well with our presentation for the end of biology lab! And tomorrow I don't want to go to school because my only test is in biology class, and I haven't studied, but I don't care that much. Hmm, what else is there to say. I have a lot of free time!! Now more because school is already over, so during the next week, I'm going to read the homework for film study class, and I'm going to use my server more, I'm going to configure or set up some things for home automation, I can't wait, I want to buy sensors, and it's good that they don't cost a lot of money. I've gained a lot of weight, I've gained weight, now I weigh 190 free!! Ten more than before, what a scandal, maybe I'll lose weight during the break I also want to learn golang, or at least use it for something small, like creating a basic server, it's a new challenge

Hmmm, what else, I think I did okay, more than a 90...I hope ;-;.  I was in the library and felt like I was getting no work done, and needed to pee, so I decided to get up and move to the fitness center and the change in scenery sparked my productivity again! I was also.playing around with thunderas once I got.home. daniel ordered some 2tb drives for me! I can't wait to add them in. I DIDNT DO TRASH ON DATA STRUXTURES AND JAVA FINAL, man, you have to believe that I thought I did very badly, trash, I thought I failed, well I didn't fail, but at least a C, dr Mina is very loving and understanding! I think that's why he gave me an A, a high A.  Tomorrow I have the biology laboratory presentation, I want to finish it now!! We've already made our slides, so we'll see how it goes tomorrow.

I didn't know he was going to be there, I talked to Kalisha and Chanel, it's been many months since I've seen them! I was a little bit uncomfortable. But what can I do. I decided to play with my server, and at the start, I forgot my password!! Ayy I was panicking, but I remembered it, and configured SSH. Also at the skillman meeting, I had to sign a w9 form, but I can't! So I decided, well, I talked to the lady and told her that they don't have to pay me, and she said yes! So I don't have to sign anything at all! Also!! I FIXED THE PROGRAMMING BUG, ​​OH I MUST BE SO EXCITED EEE I'VE BEEN FIVE HOURS WORKING ON IT, OH I need to add my hours, but yeah!!, yeah I'm really excited, I'm not going to think about the site for the rest of the week, or at least, I hope so xD. I hope. There aren't any more bugs!!! But still, tomorrow I'll study more for religion, for the data structures final, at the beginning, it was REALLY HARD, and I had no confidence in myself or my performance, and it's the same for the java final, but the gui section was easy. After that I played around and explored the changes in skybeta, saa now I'm going to sleep, oh. I also sneaked the 25 dollars back into Ben's bag xD

    Entry: PAINNNNNNNNNNNN, I CAN'T FIND A SOLUTION FOR THIS BUG EEEEEE, it's so frustrating!! I've been trying to fix it for 5 hours! And I got nothing ;-;. The eventlisteners are not working the way I want, I have to find a way to make it so that I can get rid of the eventlisteners, and it's not going to be easy 😭😭, tomorrow I have to study for the ds and java exam, so I'll try not to work on it, but I can't promise you anything, I also have the meeting at skillman foundstion tomorrow, wish me luck ;-;. I got a haircut, and I need to take a shower, so I'm going to have a really long shower after this ;-;. Ahhhhh this programming error is bothering me and frustrating me AAA, I hope I don't have the meeting with dr qian tomorrow because I have the call with Mark too, but his name is not sent the zoom link. I don't know. I'm taking a deload week this week, I need it ;-;. There are only five left, so four days! I don't have to take the calculus final, and I can get rid of my final. So I don't worry too much for the biology test. Ben bought the textbook for the film study, and I want to give him 25 dollars but he doesn't want to take it!!! And I forgot! I need to study religion 😭😭😭, I'll do it tomorrow after the meetings and the tests, what a busy week, now I'm going to take a shower, and calm down, because I need it

    Entry: It’s weird to have a close friend like andre, ben said something, well, he said it a few days ago, but he said that i know andre like a brother, and i guess, well now i don’t believe it’s true!! I know that he usually hides his feelings, well sometimes, a lot of times, i hide my feelings too, and to be honest, i can talk to ben about deeper things than andre, well look who sent a message xD, ben just sent me a message,, talking about data structures ;-; Well, that’s all i wanted to say about that matter, i played around with my server, and it’s a bit overwhelming, there are a lot of videos on youtube, but usually i can’t find a good and concise video, but also a video that explains everything better! I guess i need to keep looking for videos ;-;. Now i have opencloud and plex server, tomorrow i will watch more videos on how to use them. I went to the concert with eyutooni,.but also with nyny!! I had fun there, I was also watching words bubble up like cherry soda, it's an anime movie, it's not wonderful, but it's very cute, or at least I think so. I studied a little for religion class, but tomorrow I'll study more, also for data structures and Java class, I don't have much faith in my abilities, well, I have to trust in God and know that he's going to help me. I played beat saber, ehhhh, now I want to sleep! Then I'll see you, I don't have much more to say

I went to daniel’s house today and we set up my server, i will play with it tomorrow.. now i’m sleepy, i did some work on the site, i made almost 800 - 900 dollars working with her this semester :D, and also with uni, now it’s almost perfect! Or so i hope. Also today daniel mentioned something, well, in passing, he thanked god for his talent in writing code, and usually, well i never do that, i don’t want to believe that i have it as a talent, and i always want to think that i worked and improved my skills myself, and now i realize that that’s stupid, if i can do something well, then why should i deny it!! I should give thanks to whoever it belongs to, God, and from now on, or from now on, instead of thinking that my skills are just my thing, I will give thanks to God more because he has given me the opportunity and the talentl to learn new things and write code like that!! Hmmm, or I also looked at howls castle! Its pretty interesting, but I have questions xD, and I worked on our poster for the biology lab, tomorrow I will make the study guide for the religion class, I will redo the problems for the data structure class, I need to practice more, and I should pay more attention in class!! In the coming semesters, I will pay more attention, I felt a little scared, and maybe because I think that I have developed this bad habit, but I can always change it, and there is no point in worrying now about something that comes in the future, like the film class. LH oh I am also very proud of myself, well not very proud, but I am glad that I did, I have told my mother that on Tuesday I have a meeting at six. I always have this fear that he's going to say no, or say no, but he's never really said no, and I think, well, I'm not going to analyze anything, but yeah, it's kind of interesting. And I made mac and cheese lol

    Entry: I don't know what's wrong with my mother, she's being rude again ;-;, well I can't change her. Ehh, I talked more with ben about his motivations and I have come to the conclusion that I am nobody to judge or tell him how he should live his life, and I can't change it!! Lately it is his life, 🤷‍♂️ Now I want to sleep but I also need to use the bathroom, tomorrow I'm going to Daniel's house!! We are going to set up a server :D , my server, I can't wait, but I'm also a little sad, I haven't followed my routine of doing the hackthebox lessons, sorry!!! I will continue the routine, you'll see!! I'm still reading the labyrinth of spirits, and now I understand why it is taking me so long to finish it, it has almost 1000 pages!!! Yes, if you heard me right, almost 1000, I think it will take me another month to finish it, and I still don't know what book I want to read next, but it will surely be in english!! My brain can't take it sometimes ;-;. Now I can make the website for my dad's friend, how cool xD. I will use Shopify because it's cheaper, oh no!! I need to pay to use it, well, there is squarespace but it's quite limited, it will take me a long time if I decide to make the starter site. So, I better use squarespace. In the calculus test. Dr archey gave us 5 minutes to talk to each other, she's a wonderful teacher, I also need to study more for the data structures and java exam. Dr qian sent me an email saying that I need to make the data save between blocks! It's not that hard. And I will try to finish it tomorrow. Oh my mom is UGh shes :so annoying!!! She wants me to stay up late and hang the clothes! So stupid ugh, AAH, well, if i,fall asleep, I fall asleep, itll be an interesting experience to sleep in the sitting room lolll.i was gonna try to write something to analyze and determine why shes doing something like this, she probably feels underappreciated, well I'm pretty sure she does, but then again, it's useless to try to understand her, so imma just let it be

    Entry: I've written SOOOOO many lines of xodigo, fixed a lot of bugs, I need to add them in the excel sheet, I talked to normal, ben's twin, and it's very interesting, they have a very close relationship xD, in their own way. Now I'm waiting for sky's concert in live eeee, at the game show awards, Aurora was there! And they talked about sky cotl

    Entry: I’ve been on a call with ben for tsk three hours now!! I don’t blame him, I talked to him about the *person* thing and he gave me some good advice and I feel calmer now. Uhh, I made the video, and I think I did good on my second try, I decided to do it on a whim, and I hope she likes it xD. Hmmm, I did some work on dr qian’s site, I need to apply the changes to the other tests, but I will do that tomorrow. I worked out and enjoyed it, my jaw hurts less, heals, heals little frog tail, if it doesn’t heal today, it will heal tomorrow, I still don’t know if the rhyme goes like that, but I don’t care xD. OH, I passed the biology test! With a 46/50, well, 47, because he marked a question wrong, how cool.

    Entry: Today was a day full of so many lines of code ;-;, but now, i’m losing faith in my code ;-;, so i decided to close vscode and do something else, if i don’t have time, i’ll message kalisha telling her that i want to make a date instead of a video because i can’t find the time to make a video, well i have the time, but i don’t have the patience!!!! i can’t spend another two hours making a video;-;. i helped my dad with his work again, he doesn’t have school anymore :D. Hmmm, i played sky with ethan!! But just a little bit, and i also had a call with ben. Ayy today was full of feelings of contempt towards a person, because, well, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter, when i repeat that, it means that it does matter, but i don’t want to waste time talking about something useless. Hmm, not much else to say! I wrote a lot of code ouch, my head hurts, also something new has come with ai called gpt chat and it's amazing and interesting, but it also scares me, I think in general, AI is very scary, but it's so fascinating and useful that I want to learn how to do it. Oh, I went out with cru to Bucharest grill with andy and well, I had fun. Ehh, I worked out today. It's been a while since I've seen Raphael and nosh at the gym, how weird. Sky's concert is coming in two days eeeee. Tomorrow, I want to add the IBT changes to the other tests, I've changed a lot, and to be honest, I feel a little overwhelmed, or as I've already told you, I don't have faith in my code!! I need to pass it more, there's something in me that doesn't like changes It's a problem for me tomorrow, see you

    Entry: Oops my brain hurts ;-;, i wrote too many lines of code, i posted the changes and told dr qian and she sent me some feedbacks and recommendations. One was that i should make the user be able to take more than one test, and that will show all the data, and my first idea didn’t work, at least thank god i found a way to fix it, and tomorrow, i will apply the changes, also the be ibt test changes for the other tests. It shouldn’t take me too long, famous last words ;-;. Apart from that, i tried to film the video for dpscd, it took me two hours!!! TWO HOURS, just for something that only needs 2 or 3 minutes, and the video i sent was not even good ;-;. Kalisha asked me if i could redo the video and speak slower, and i understand her one hundred percent, i will do it tomorrow, and this time, i will write a script or something, so that i don’t keep talking rubbish ;-;. I didn't have my calculus class today, but I didn't do anything productive with that time because I spent it trying to film the video xD. I tried to finish a high school knewton but I didn't get anywhere ;-;. ehhh what else is there to say. I also helped my dad with some of his homework, his school ends tomorrow, how exciting for him!

    Entry: Finally, a day I can be lazy :p. At the beginning of my day, I was feeling a bit angry? I don’t know but I got over that feeling pretty soon, worked on the safety rules, and even though it doesn’t work the way I want, I learned something new. I also wanted to use imagekit but it seems it doesn’t work with vue 3 ;-;. I’ll try to look into it, or more sites or apps that do the same. Afterwards I played with my vr, it’s been a long time since I’ve done that, I played sky with nyny and we had fun, we played in beta! My ear still hurts, and I’m going to quit, I hope it heals like this. Tomorrow, I hope to see Raphael at the gym, I want to talk to him about his gift and his drawing ability! Today I want to sleep early. Apart from all that, I watched simpsons episodes. Tomorrow I’ll make the dpscd video for ms kalisha, I’ll do it after working out, maybe in the library. I don’t have a calculus class tomorrow!! Then I can stay in the library, ben just texted me 😂😂, I was thinking about that just now xD, how funny Now I'm sitting on the toilet, other than that, I don't have much else to say, I think I have to tell my parents that we're going to Daniel's house next week, I don't know, I don't know

    Entry: Another very very busy day, I got home at ten, and left the house at seven!! Almost, well more than 12 hours!!! But I had fun, not a lot, but I had fun. The team I wanted to win didn't win ;-;, but I brought with me a game card? I don't know, I'm really sleepy, and two flash drives. Yesterday, there was the anime club party, and we played villains, a board game, I drank this juice with a little piece of marble in it to open it, and I met this guy, Raphael, he's the guy I usually see working out in the morning, and he has a really soft voice, he's wonderful, I didn't get my gift but I will get it on Tuesday or Wednesday, my ear still hurts aaaa, and it doesn't look like it's going to get better anytime soon

    Entry: AAAAAAA I wanna finish this ;-;, my streak;-;, ughhh, eeee, this feeling is so strong!! My soul hurts ;-;. I crossed 225lbs in barbell close grip and to be honest, I didn’t feel happy or anything, for me, or what I think is normal now. But other than that, two exciting things happened today!! First, the new season has arrived on sky eeeeee, it’s in the knowledge vault, and I love music, I like cosmetics, but I’m not intrigued by history or spirits, well, there’s one spirit that I like lol. I felt so excited when it arrived xD. There’s another stress test, but it happens at twelve and I need to sleep and prepare for the biology exam, oh even now I feel guilty, even though I haven’t done anything yet, but aaaaaa, I don’t want to think about it no no. Hmm, then I had my call with dr qian and I have good news, she is working with the university of Wisconsin and she showed them my site and they loved it, so I have to do a test for them, to be honest I think I will be able to finish it before the end of the week, there are not many difficult things, actually, only easy things left, so I can finish it really fast, I want to secure firebase and make the images download faster, but those are things I can do later, you should have done them during the break xD. Well I can't change the past, I hope my site works well xD. I am a little stressed, but I am confident in my code, but I still need to test it more and more and many times xD. Also its the IBT so its not really difficult, there are only 4 sections. So I will be able to do it easily. I couldn't find the computer and I am going to talk to daniel about it to see if he can help me build my server, I can go to his house ooo. Ehhh, I saw a Yoruba video. And I have to say, it is a fascinating language LOLL, I can't believe it, I've had this fascinating language in front of me and I didn't even realize it, I still only understand the basics, but now I think I want to learn more, not how to, but yeah. I think that's it? Yep yep. I don't have much to do, and I like the things I have to do.

    Entry: I have more to say xD. Aaaa I want to talk in English, there are so many deep things I want to say. Well, just two, ahhh but now when I think about it, it all seems so stupid or dumb, like, not worth talking about. It's so frustrating because it usually bothers me, and when I want to articulate my thoughts, it seems dumb. I'm going to look at my past posts to see if I have more drawers than now ;-; Edit Bad idea ;-; Aaaahh im just going to get this off my chest, it bugs me a lot, a lot! When people show off? But does it bug me because I do it a lot too!! Its annoying and its something I have to talk to God about, because it's one of those feelings, one of those, ugh, feelings!!!. aaaaa lol future mes gonna be confused, I have a specific scenario in mind but it's too stupid to bring up, imma head to bed, o i played roblox with some interesting people and had fun, i fought with two girls and let my brain not work and let my hands do their job, ethan just lowered makima in karuta;-;

    Entry: Oh i feel great i just got back from destress fest, first of all well i wanna start with the start of my day. i had another fun dream!! Actually two interesting dreams!! Both were set in a class at detroit.merxy, well the second one happened at the fitness center, like destress fest!! But instead there was a soccer game and i saw obby and ben and some other guy that i can't remember. ..Ehhh i have everything in my dream journal xD. My dad left for work really early so i used uber, i only worked out for maybe 20 minutes because there was no time ;-;, but i liked the section. Afterwards i ate a lot of candy in calculus class because we played a battleship game and dr archey brought us candy. Ehhh i got a temporary tattoo xD. Oh oh i have dhack's call in twelve minutes!! i think i can get home early. Afterwards, we arrived at the destress fest, I want to write in English so I don't limit my thoughts and my self, at first I got there and felt a bit overwhelmed, I didn't see anyone I knew, so I walked upstairs and saw the music club, they're pretty good!! I met a new girl named Ali I think, she's pretty good and has a fun personality, I totally don't have a crush on her!! &gt;:(, shes looking for boyfriends lol, Noah wasn't there, hes an architecture student, I'm not ultra surprised but yeah, and he has a house!!!! Yeah right, oh I feel stupid lol, ehh, I spent a lotta time with josephine! We made slime and it was pretty funny, there was hot cocoa tsmbien! My brother was there, but it looked like he wasn't having fun at all, or distressing, but I guess that's just my POV.&nbsp;..Hmmm. 8 minutes and we are almost home, I enjoyed today, I finished the last knewton alta for taylor series loll, I need to study for the exam, there's also a biology exam on Friday, and there's a lot of things I need to remember!! So tomorrow I'll study more and more, I need to pass this exam, wait! I think we don't have an exam this week, just a test, he said that we're going to have our test on plants before we have the exam, I don't know. We have arrived home thank God, see you later. I think I'm forgetting something

    Entry: I have to start with this, I had the weirdest and funny dream xD. I was in dr Carmona’s class when he told us that we have to put something like butt plugs LOl, something white and small, in our butts, hadi was there too but we did it and everything felt normal, I remember having that feeling that I get when I do something new. But especially something bad? Something exciting? Well I don’t know, I can explain it better in english, but I felt warm, well, my butt felt warm LOL Changing the subject!! My jaw still hurts, and now my back hurts too ugh, now it’s not bad, it’s improved, but it’s very frustrating, my jaw is frustrating too. I had a lot of fun at the cru session, but I also need to absorb what I learned, I need to reevaluate my motivations, what I want to achieve in the future, to be honest with you, I don’t know, I have no idea, and maybe I don’t want to know, it seems like a silly thing to me, because I can die at any moment, and then what will happen. In the past, I have spent many hours thinking about what I want to achieve or do in the future, or the kind of person I want to be, and almost always, something ruins my plans! So why should I bother worrying about the future, it’s pointless, but at least, I can evaluate my thoughts and my actions now. Now, I’m trying to get closer to God by giving up my bad habits, and I’m doing that, I don’t want to lose motivation, and I don’t want to lose my discipline, but it’s also not something I can lose, it’s something I can feed to grow, and I can only feed it with the words of God. Hmm, I played more with kali linux hehe, I can't wait to do more complicated stuff, I haven't been able to practice with lens studio!!! I will tomorrow, we also have a training call, and I couldn't join today's call because I had Java class, but I'll have free time tomorrow. Oh and I need to find a computer ugh, I've been procrastinating ;-; oh I want to sleep a little earlier, I don't have much more to say, but yeah, my brother wore his maids clothes, uh

The most notable thing is that my jaw hurts!! It hurts a lot, and apart from that, there's nothing to say!! Oh, I think that today will be one of those days where I don't write much, see you tomorrow, maybe something. More interesting will happen, very interesting, not bad.

    Entry: Finally, I got bored today, I watched blue lock, the soccer anime, and it’s very interesting. I also watched some episodes of dragonball, and my hero academia, and sk8, oh I watched a lot of anime today ;-;. Ehh I also tried to learn more about Taylor series in calculus, and I understand it better. But I still don’t feel very confident in my skills, I need her to explain it to me more, maybe I will use her office hours. Ehh, I used snapchat lens studio, and at first, I felt really really REALLY overwhelmed, and I wanted to give up, but I decided to create a filter, and learn how to do something and then, I will close the app, and I did it, and I felt really proud of myself!! Good job, and congratulations :D. Tomorrow I will do the same, I will see how to do something with the whole body, oh in two days, we have the training call!! Check through snapchat to see the common filters. And I understood how they did it, and I knew I could create those with the skills and knowledge I've increased- with God's help of course. Ehh. Tomorrow we go back to school!!, I'll finally be able to lift weights again!!! I did the data structures class and I wanted to turn in the calculus essay, but I didn't. I think I forgot! Other than that, I don't think I did much today, I didn't play with my vr, my mom made some really good steaks, ehh, it was raining, and I woke up really early, my brother wasn't there and I thought I got raptured, I don't know how to say it in Spanish xD, and the funny thing is that I think I knew that wasn't the case, but I didnt feel disappointed, like I had accepted my faith if that makes sense, whenever I do you know, I feel that I'm far away from God, and that I don't deserve to be in his presence, so I continue with my plan eee, I want to do this boy! And now, I want to sleep early, and read a little

    Entry: I don’t know how to explain today, I was pretty productive, buuuut, also not? I’ll explain. I didn’t exercise, well, today is Saturday. I just realized that yes!! Today is Saturday. I woke up thank God. Hmm, I finished the high school knewton, and I’m still confused, very VERY confused, I don’t understand what’s going on. So tomorrow, I’m going to watch the videos again, hopefully then, I’ll understand what’s going on. Yes, even now. I’m thinking about what I’ve learned, but I can’t think of anything!! How disappointing. Tomorrow I’ll watch the videos and take notes. Hmm, I also read the anatomy of the sacred, I didn’t want to do it tomorrow. I also read the chapter for Wednesday. So I won’t have much to do during the week. Ehh, I practiced more with Snapchat lens studio. I just figured out the documentation, so I’ll use that to practice more this week, I still have a week to improve my skills dude!!! Get your act together :D, I sent a message to the msrcomm group but no one has answered me, so I guess I'll either tell ms vanita, or I'll have the meeting with Mark alone. I'm not worried. Ehh, recently, a lot of people have seen my LinkedIn profile ;-;. I don't have much there, so I'm not worried too much, ben has finished his gym, and we talked about his game, he's already given it a name - dio's mafia, it's italian and it's an interesting name, I haven't asked, but he'll need someone to do the voices of the characters! Well, I guess he's already thought about that. And I sent a message to daniel because I want to have a meeting. During the week because I want to start my server, I'm pretty excited. I also "played" mss with Linux and hackerbox, oh I love saying that, it makes me feel really cool xD. It's something I'm going to continue. I've already said it, and I think I need to say it again. It seems like the days are FLYING AWAY, like. WHY??? I don't do much, I was watching my hero academia and to be honest I still like it, it's a very interesting anime, I caught up on the block clover manga. And finally my stickers arrived!! I've crushed them on my computer XD. I can't tell if today has been a productive day or not. Well, at least I can't change the day. And I can only move on. It's been an interesting but pretty normal day, I'm not complaining.

    My mood Unsure
    
    Entry: I feel like garbage but also not ;-;, well, ugh my computer is acting weird but I started the day off pretty productively, I made a lot of progress with the changes on dr qian’s site, ehh, I downloaded a virtual machine and learned how to use it - just the basics, I also decided I want to learn a bit about hacking, so on kali linux, I have a basic course, well, it’s not a course, it’s a website to learn stuff like that, I’m not really excited about it but it’s something I want to do. Also because ben thinks I can hack, so why not xD, maybe I’ll learn a lot and someday I’ll surprise him. Hmm, I feel like garbage because I just did you know what, and andre asked me to send him pictures of some of my calculus classes, and I didn’t want to do it but I decided that I’m going to send them because really, I have no reason not to send it, but it disgusts me? I can’t describe it. I have a lot of feelings about it, but I can't explain them :*), so it's better not to make the situation worse. I think if I write it down in English, I'll be able to explain my thoughts better, but I also feel like there's nothing to explain because every time I want to say something, I find that I have some kind or type or class of cognitive dissonance. I know it's the right thing to do, but I also know how I feel, and the two don't match ;-;. Maybe if I write it down, I'll still feel better and in the future I might be able to relate, it boils down to I don't want to help someone who doesn't put in the work. I'm fine working and sharing stuff with ben cause in reality, he does put in the work a lot, and I xant even pinpoint the exact moment in my relationship with Andre where everything kinda went downhill - pretty extreme way to say it tho, it didn't go downhill, but it got harder and harder for me to look at him eye to eye, like, really hard, maybe that means something, it 200 percent does and I wonder if he has noticed it, I remember talking with him recently and found maintaining eye contact super difficult ugh, and now I felt pretty weird sending my notes cause a part of me was like - It feels awkward, I put in work to understand and hes jsut going to write it all down and get the points and I prolly wouldnt hear the end of how he got an in calculus two somehow, but still ugh! It's difficult because I know I should still love him - biblical wise, and then I do stuff like you know what and it makes me feel even worse cause then it's like, I'm holding myself to a high standard here, and a low low LOW standard there, its annoying!!! I recently quit cigarettes and I wanna join him in the quitting of unhealthy habits! Hmm, I should go back to speaking Spanish, I feel like my thoughts have reduced a lot like that, because there are days like this when I can't speak Spanish fluently and I can't explain my thoughts but there are also days where everything seems to flow!! I really want to reach a point where I can write my thoughts in Spanish with the same depth and substance as when I write in English. Looking on the bright side, I learned more about docker containers and virtual machines, and I decided not to buy a new phone, but I did get the one punch man stickers. Docker containers are very interesting, or at least I think so, I want to buy a computer to use as a server, and to practice more with docker, now I know what it is, is that a way to balance it out? Or load an entire application, with all its dependencies, env variables, etc., and they are very fast, I downloaded docker hub on my computer and watched a video on how we can dockerize an application, I will try it in the near future. Hmm, I also used virtualbox to download kali linux, it is so easy!!! So easy!! And I can do it again without the tutorial, I also think it is more useful than dual booting. To learn more about hacking, when I come back from the gym and I am in the library before calculus class, I will use that time to practice and use it. I always get a weird feeling when I learn something new, and I like that feeling, it is like I have a superpower and my body is absorbing the knowledge!! I also think I came at the right time, because I was starting to feel like I have not learned anything new, and I am not progressing in my skills, but now, I can practice with new skills!! Not only front end, but I'm also using that with the site and now the coding club project, but now I'm going to improve my skills and knowledge of servers and how to use them. Now I'm feeling motivated, maybe I should change my mood for the day O I also played les mills and sweated a lot, a great day of exercise. I knew it, writing here has boosted my mood, and now I can't wait for new challenges! O O O O O O O O And I FINISHED THE BERSERK MANGA, how exciting, now I don't know when they're going to post a new chapter, and I can't wait! Wow I wrote a lot today, when I speak in English, I notice that it's I wrote more! Maybe I should write in English when I know I couldn't explain my feelings in Spanish without much difficulty.

    Entry: Today was an interesting day, I was pretty productive, I want to see how many things I did today, I finished the biology test, and I solved the problem in the ds code and now I'm done with the project, so. I still need to write comments in my code, but that's nothing. I worked on the changes and finished the form, I want to wait until dr qian answers me, but I think I'll continue with the test tomorrow. I'll try to finish it. It shouldn't take me too long, but it will take me a bit to edit the images ;-;. Well I have three days until school starts again. Uhh, I cooked a pizza and made a high school knewton, the subject still confuses me, so tomorrow I'll study more about it, I played more with lens studio and oh I feel like I know nothing at all! And I don't feel ready to do this at all ;-;, but I still have a week I think, and I have time to learn more and watch tutorials ;-;. Also other interesting things happened today. Ehh this "popular" guy i guess, connected with me on linkedin because of the cs posters thingy i made. i still have to thank dr kalisha for choosing me!!! Ay yea Ehh i played bonelab and beat saber, i love aurora songs, i found out another song, cure for me, on beat saber, and i enjoyed it. Ehh, i played roblox too. My mom made a turkey, oops where are my manners ( msnners ), happy thanksgiving days!!!!! Yeah, it's not that cold, in fact, it's hot :*(, but i survive. i want to talk to other people in spanish!! Maybe i should start using hellotalk again lol, or and i always have this fight with myself, it's about whether i want to buy a new phone or not, and now, i decided not to. i didn't work out today ;-;, the days are going by so fast, i don't know! i'm almost done with berserk! i enjoy it a lot, now i want to go to sleep, see you

    Entry: Today went by really really fast. I made some churros, they didn't turn out bad but I wasn't crazy about them, they weren't very crispy, and I made mac n cheese, I loved it. I also had a call with ben, he made a site in react and I helped him with some issues, the react syntax is pretty weird but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. I started making changes to the project but I couldn't do much because ben called me and I was really distracted. I did some reading, oh my days are starting to look so similar, yes I'm reverting to english for a bit, I had something important that I wanted to say, now I can't remember ;-;, wait now I remember. Things here have been looking super bland! Like, not festivey? Do you understand me? I dont have the vibe that I like, maybe I just don't notice it now, and maybe it's because I have some work to do over the break, not a lot of work by the way! But still, and even then, I'd rather have work than be lazy, being unproductive can sometimes feel much much worse than having something to do, but it's even worse when I only have one or two important things to do does the day! For example, I'm trying to take lead in the scp marcom and they aren't responding ;-;, I'll send another message. Uhhh, what else, I still have to practice more with the, lol I wrote with without realizing it, snapchat software, and I was showing ben three js projects and they are amazing and I want to learn it even more!! But I also want to learn more about servers and how they work, and I want to make my own server ughh , I also want to read more books, I want, I want, I always have wants, it's a futile pursuit to be honest, as, I will never be enough for myself, I will always want more and more. Unrelated note, I finally modded bonelab and got a cool lightsabe mod LOL. Also now there's a part of me that wants to learn how to hack, it's a small part, but it exists :*). Well, at least I have time, whatever that means, that's why today, I don't feel happy, or happyish. The day went by super quickly, and I feel like I didn't accomplish anything, nothing at all, I didn't even exercise much! I played thrill of the fight and recorded a video of myself fighting to critique my form and technique and I realized that my form is horrible, well, it's not horrible, but it's not great at all, and the headset kept fogging and overall made me feel quite bummed. At least my mom is making a turkey tomorrow!! I can't wait, tomorrow, after I finish the project, or at least, I hope I can finish it very soon, I'll be able to play roblox!! Oh I really want to play it. I was writing code and I felt very disillusioned, dissapointed, I think I let the praises get into my head and I no longer acknowledge my achievements, number one, and number two, I get quite frustrated when something doesnt work, I know I'm close to getting it working , so I don't worry too much, but I still feel a little bad that I couldn't figure out the problem and finish the project. I also have to take the biology test - I think, no, I'll do it tomorrow, after I get up, I'll be very productive, first I'll work on the ds project, then on knewton alta, after that, the biology test, and I'll continue with the changes with dr qian and Najat. It shouldn't take me long, actually, I think the survey will take me the most time, and I'm working on a way to optimize it already!! Now I want to read the Bible, something I've also been slacking on, and do Duolingo to practice Greek. Oops this has been a pretty long post, I think its because I was alternating between English and Spanish and I was able to express myself better, maybe I should continue like this! Nahh

    Entry: There's not much I want to say. I answered dr qian and Najat and tomorrow, I'll start with the changes. Ehh, I didn't have much to do, dr mina gave us a new project with the calculator gui, but I already did it, so I'm not worried haha. I want to finish some high school knewtons and the essay we need to write. Ehh I also have to take the test in biology class. At least we do it online. I went to the gym in the afternoon today because my brother wanted to go later, my mom just asked me about it xD. I played a little bone lab and beat saber and I'm learning more about the servers and how they work, and we didn't have cru, so I went to the anime club meeting

    Entry: Oh, I'm not feeling great, so I guess I'll use a template, I'll have another post. I'll give you a summary of my day, um actually, it wasn't bad! I worked out and I saw noah. He was brushing his teeth in the gym bathroom, and that made me think that he lived in his car, what a stupid thought ;-;, of course I'm not going to ask him xD..Afterwards I had the calculus test, and I'm still a little mad because I knew how to solve a problem, but I got confused or something, oh, I don't know, I don't know. There was no religion class. And najat sent me an email with the details of her project. I'm going to answer her, and that means I finally have something to do!!! There are some weird things I'm going to ask her, and I have to "clean up" the images, but yeah, I'll do all that at the library tomorrow, of course after I work out. Hmm, I emailed my brother m, I finally did it.&nbsp;..I came back home and played bonelab, I enjoy it way more than the beginning, then ben called me, oh my head was already broken xD. But yeah, Ethan had a series of weird but entertaining events, he burned the plate in the microwave, and went out to buy a new cover, and wants to see if his parents will notice. Oh and I read, I love the story and the characters..I feel very light, ...Why do I feel bad, omeh? Well, I had another moment of bad nostalgia, I don't understand the feeling, and maybe I should look on the internet to see what others say. Now I'm going to sleep, a little early I know,

    Entry: Oh I almost wrote here in english, today was a pretty quick day, I had a scp call with ben, he's almost finished his project, and at least, it will mean I can play bonelab and roblox during the break. Speaking of bonelab, I've reached the interesting parts!! I've already unlocked my characters ;D, and now I can change them. Hmmm, my mom made soup with a lot of weird meats xD, there were even lungs. I want to sleep early because I have the calculus test tomorrow! With the power of God, I will pass the test

    Entry: I talked a lot with ben today, and we talked about life and his motivations, very interesting stuff, we were on a call for a long time, but at least he finished his java project!! Now we start with his ds project xD. I studied for the calculus exam, now I'm more ready, and I feel confident, but there are things I need to practice. Now I want to use the bathroom but my brother is there ;-;. I want to talk about something deeper, my conversation with ben. It seems to me that he is a very similar guy to me, sometimes I don't understand his own mind and the motivation of his actions, and even though he wants to change, his state or his nature prevents it. And I also talked to him about my reservations about my talent, well, maybe I shouldn't ignore it and instead, I should thank God for giving me this ability!!! I don't want to and I won't be conceited!! Maybe I'll read my past entries xD. I haven't changed that much, but I know that I have matured. I had the call with daniel and we talked about docker and servers, and I want to learn how he does his stuff, so I'm going to watch videos tomorrow, I'm also going to practice with snapchat lens studio this thanksgiving break, actually, during the break, I don't have much to do, I'll use that time to improve my skills, and also learn more about dockers and servers. And I'm excited to start his project. OH I HAVE GREAT NEWS, I FIXED MY KINDLE, I took it apart to remove the batteries! And now it works! I'm very happy and I have to keep it warm

    Entry: Hi. You won't believe it, well, you have to believe it because you have experienced it, but for biology lab, we went to metro park and I just got back to college. A lot of good things happened. First, I went with Hadi in his car, it snowed a lot!! But to be honest, I loved it, it looked so neat. Then, we got there and it was really really cold, my fingers and ears hurt! But it survived, although my back hurts xD. I used my camera to take pictures, I saw a hawk and some deer! ( deer )!!! I hope my mom isn't home, because then I can relax a lot. But yes, it's almost everything I wanted to do and experience when I was younger and wanted to be a wildlife biologist!!! There were trees, and birds, and a lake, very very beautiful. After taking the samples, we went to sort the samples in a room, and I went back to college with dr Carmona and Casey!! I have a lot of pictures and I will add them here when I put them on my computer. Also, ALSO FINALLY, I FINALLY TALKED TO NOAH, his name is Noah!!! Ok so, after I presented my projects at IDRAW day with dr bani taan - I'm glad he decided to do it, but afterwards, I decided to go to tdr instead of having dinner with journi. So! I saw hadassah with him, and he was sitting alone, near andre's, josphine's table, oh why are you using so many details!! But the first thing he asked me was - have you worked out today, something like that, and I said yes. I asked what his name was, and I also told him my name. I had to go to biology class, so I left, but yes! I feel kinda dumb because I don't know!! In my head, I imagine the worst, I need to tell my brother about the african caribbean club meeting or something. And on the subject of noah, he has a very intense look, i don’t know how to describe it, so i decided not to talk to him or ignore his presence, i’m not jealous of him, i don’t know anything about him, i just learned his name!!! But yes! Maybe it’s the beginning of a new relationship. He’s a mysterious person and i want to learn more about him, right now i’m writing too much. i almost left my backpack in hadi’s car!!! Good thing he didn’t get out of there!!!!!! i had to go outside to find his car, but i couldn’t find it xD. At least i have it now, thank god!!!! When i get back home, i need to find a way to fix my kindle! And i want to play beat saber!!!!

There's not much to say and I'm sleepy. My kindle is acting weird again! And it doesn't work, I have to charge it, or so I think, also Aurora's song is squashed in my brain, I was listening to warrior when pisewigeon texted me saying we were listening to the same song, how exciting xD See you tomorrow. Or I could finish the ds project

I live and learn. I was working on the ds project. There's something I need to clarify, but later, I'll be able to finish the project :D. Hmmm, it snowed today, and I love it as always, and now I have a new sweater, and I love it, I didn't see the boy today, a common thought. Today, I liked cru, he seemed like the cru from before. I tried not to prolong the conversations, and I enjoyed myself. I've been laughing a lot recently, it makes me happy. Also the birds are coming back :D. Tomorrow is the maid cafe, and I don't have much to say, so I'm going to sleep now, bye

And I think I look really cute in it xD. Or and I think I finally found a way to fix the data structures project!!! Hm I really don’t have much more to say I saw the guy that we’re not gonna talk about, and I acted normal!! We always have that awkward moment of eye contact!! It’s like we’re thinking the same thing and we want to talk, or at least, see the other person, but noOoO. He’s most likely not even going to pay attention to me, I want to talk to him about his tattoos, and I still don’t know his name, ughh I’m thinking too much now, I shouldn’t have ignored him eeee, if I said hi to him, I wouldn’t be acting like this 😭😭, but I can’t change the past, so here we are :*). What a shame.com Is it obvious that I’m still looking at her? I’m going to sleep now

    Entry: Hi hi, what's up, this morning we put up the Christmas tree and it's gorgeous. I also didn't miss my minutes for today. I took a picture of the Christmas tree. I played a little sky, and it was quite productive. I read the reading for religion class, started the poster for biology lab, and read the readings too, I made two high knewtons to practice before the exam. I watched Jenny and lilly singh videos lol, and I started dragonball, I like it a lot. My back still hurts, but it's healthy, frog tail LOl. I still haven't found a way to solve the data structures algorithm and it's a little frustrating. I also found out that Dr. Carmona's wife isn't going to teach Spanish ;-;, that's why she hasn't answered me

I missed the moment in minutiaea :(, but I don't want it to stress me out, I want to be more relaxed with the app!! I also downloaded and played this game called Alba, I don't think I'll play it anymore, but it's very interesting, it's about nature and I can learn about birds and animals there. The other team didn't show for our beat saber game, so I think we won? Ehh, I couldn't code anything!!!! I don't understand how I can do it! I'll either message dr mina or wait until Tuesday to ask her. Now I want to sleep, something's bothering me, and I guess I understand why it's bothering me, but I still do it and I get the same results. I also have that weird feeling every time I remember my maid outfit purchase. And now, I'm 89 percent sure that I feel that way because I haven't told my parents. Every time I feel that way it's because I do something I haven't told them, well, something out of the ordinary. I hope he comes tomorrow, and I can tell them, now I'm not going to think about him too much. I love the snow, I just want to say That, I love it very much

    Entry: I used to sit there so lazy, even now I want to sleep and I'm so sleepy, I think after the days when I woke up all refreshed and ready for the day, my body wants to scold me and punish me xd. I did leg day today because my body is still a bit sore, but it's better now, I didn't read today. Partly because I needed to help my dad with his work, but I also didn't feel like reading. That guy, oh I don't like that he started exercising in the morning xd. It makes me uncomfortable, oh his expensive. Ugh why does he bother me so much, I haven't even talked to him, and I don't want to xD. Oh I'm dying of embarrassment. I still remember his eyes, when he's around, I can't walk straight xD. But that's all, I'm not going to think about him anymore, he's like any other person that I don't care about, now, now. I want to buy a costume for the brown corn, but I have doubts, oh I don't want to do it, I must! Tomorrow I'll buy the clothes!! I don't want to have pity yes. Yay!!!!! I'll buy it tomorrow, I hope it arrives very fast. Oh oh oh, Mrs. Vanitss sent me my payment, but she didn't put the apartment number, and that means I probably won't get my money, what a shame.com xD. Hmm what else is there to say, ehhh. I downloaded a new app, it's called minutiae and it's like bereal, but it's not a social network, I just do it for myself, and I share my day with a stranger, or after 4 years, they're going to give me my memories in a book, I can't wait. Well yes I can wait xD, but from now on, I'll have more memories

Literally every time i move my legs or body, it hurts xd. Today was pretty interesting - i started saying this again, because i'm having a hard time thinking of another way to describe how my day went. I chatted with ben, we talked about his ideas with machine learning and AI. They're pretty interesting, or so i think. I didn't have much to do, I worked a little on the lcl project, I have a meeting with dr qian this week!! I almost forgot. Also, lyrik hasn't replied to me ;-;. I want to buy the galaxy note 10 plus, it's like 300-400 dollars, it's not that expensive, but my phone still works, unless i want to break it lol. Maybe 👀👀👀, noooo, hmmm xD. 15 minutes left!

    My mood Motivated
    
    Entry: Hi hi hi, how are you, am I okay, are you? You're okay, now shut up, let me talk hehe. I was looking for jobs on the fly like I used to, and it brought back memories. I just had a pretty obvious realization. But important I guess. If I can have a job, a good job with good pay, it wouldn't hurt me - I mean it wouldn't bother me. If I can choose my job, and make a lot of money on upwork 9 fiverr. It wouldn't hurt me either. I guess I've learned now that maybe I was suppressing my longing for a stable job? Nooo, I won't use that word, but yes. I also keep thinking about ben and our conversations about it, I guess if he asked me now, I'd tell him I'd do whatever I want! If I can get a good job, I'll do it, if I can get new clients and work alone, I'll do it!!! Now I feel much much more motivated!!! I just changed my emotion xD. I also feel like my Spanish has improved a lot now!! I feel like it doesn't bother me much now. And I think it's because recently, I've tried to incorporate the language into my daily life, now I can listen to and understand podcasts without problems, and I learn and review new words, I listen to Spanish music, I write here in Spanish, I changed the language on my phone to Italian, but I still read articles on Quora in Spanish. I just need the Spanish class teacher to answer me!!! Maybe I'll send her another email, I'll see how things go. I want to continue working with Google Earth Engine, I read another article and I'll watch more videos on how to use it better. To finish this post, I had a weird but fun dream. And I played thrill of the fight!! I also bench pressed 240 pounds!! I'll reach 250 pounds in no time - very very fast. It's my goal for this semester, I also want to be able to do 10 chinups without stopping before the end of this semester. Wish me luck!! Go and work on the project. And I found and fixed some bugs, the site isn't perfect, and I usually find new bugs, but they're easy things!!! I'll end with something weird because I don't know how to feel about it. I showed ben my github profile, I don't know why, it made me feel like I wasn't humble, and I wanted to shove it in his face, even though that's not true, or at least I don't think it is. I don't know how my brain works, but I don't care!! I did it without any bad intentions! And you and I both know that. I'll see you later, I'm going to read the bible, and we'll talk tomorrow.

    My mood Great
    
    Entry: Today, I want to say that I enjoyed myself a lot. I woke up very early and read a lot of quora articles. After that I started working on the java project. I finished another part of the project, but there are other places I need to think about how to do it, I need to add an undo functionality, count the player’s moves, and see if they have won a game. Actually, I think I can finish it tomorrow, but I probably won’t have enough time to do it, oh I need to message lyrik!! I worked with snapchat software to do some basic stuff, without worrying, and I don’t know, I enjoyed it, I’m working on something and will continue it maybe tomorrow, I’ll see how it goes, I want to finish it before the end of this week. Actually, it’s not that hard to do, there are still things I don’t know, but I can always learn, if I need something, or I don’t understand something, I can always look it up. After that, I played sky with the server, at first, I didn’t know if I wanted to do it, because sometimes I have a hard time doing things like that, but I decided to do it, and actually, I had a really really good time, and I’m glad she decided to do it. We spent a lot of time playing. But then, I worked more on the project, I found another channel like lilly singh’s and it’s wonderful and funny and it’s in spanish and english! His name is Lorenzo something and he makes me laugh a lot. And I was watching more anime episodes like summertime rendering and not just married couples, something like that. I just finished working on calculus, tomorrow I’m going to finish some high knewtons. and I can’t wait to see my grade for the biology exam. I also laughed a lot with ethan with inspirobot, the bot that makes funny-quite-quotes.

Vanita wasn't there, and maybe I think that's a good thing, I prefer the other woman, Sydney, she's more, or at least, it seems that she's more Real or transparent than Vanita. But I don't know, I don't know. I was working on the Java project. And I think I'm almost done, well, I've already finished the hard part. Now it shouldn't take me too long. Mansns I'll finish it, and I'll finish the essay for the biology class. Now I'm going to sleep, we went to the restaurant and had the food, it wasn't great, I think I could have cooked something better, but what counts is the experience, bye

I have the scp call tomorrow, but ms vanita won’t be there, so she can’t scold us xD. Tomorrow I’ll finish my biology lab essay, I’ve already started it, but I need to refine it. I’ve also started researching algal blooms, and I’m feeling pretty excited, I was playing around with earth engine and I have some ideas. There are also studies that have done something similar with earth engine, but not with urban forests. And now I’ve added new emotions!

    Entry: Yaheia is a cool guy, we had a study session together and now, I’m more prepared for the biology exam. My head hurts, but only the bottom part - bass. I just discovered a new part of the library. There are some booths with a whiteboard, now I have a place I can go when I need to do a zoom call or something, every day I learn something new. Ben has started applying for internships and I feel like I have to let him go xD. It’s a pretty crazy thought, but I usually think of him as my disciple, even though he’s 21!! Sheesh 4 years older. I enjoyed my day at the gym, maybe I’ll start doing cardio later in the day, something light, but something to get my heart rate up, I haven’t played thrill of the fight in a while. I changed the language on my phone to Italian!! I’m sure I won’t understand much of it, but it’s a way to practice it. I like my level of Spanish, I usually find that I am thinking in Spanish or I am talking to myself in Spanish, and I no longer need to translate the language in my head before I can understand it. My grammar has improved a lot, but I also know that I need to talk to other people and I can't just talk to myself or just listen to podcasts!! Dr Carmona hasn't replied to me yet, I hope he says yes. Speaking of emails, dr qian replied to my email, there was a mistake in the code but I fixed it, thank goodness. I don't usually use that phrase, I should use it more. I was pretty productive today, I studied for the biology exam, it's been a while since I've worked on my project, but I've started working on the Java project, now I need to find a way to come up with the algorithm, oops I've talked too much, I want to sleep.

My first client :D, besides dr qian, I’m pretty excited because she also told me she wants to keep working with me and wants to grow her site! I want to find more people who I can work with! On a different topic, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by google earth engine, because dr carmona won’t be at UDeR next year, he’s leaving, and he’ll leave me with a new professor – a professor who knows nothing about google earth engine, like me xd. But, but I can look at it as a good thing, we can learn it together! Or at least, I hope so. I keep reading the labyrinth of spirits. And there are whole chapters where I can’t understand anything, but there are also days like today or yesterday, where I don’t need to think much, and I can read it relatively easily. Hmm, I did a workout today, and enjoy it, tomorrow I’ll work on my biceps and triceps, I had the beat saber contest and we lost, but that’s okay. I started working on the Java project because I find it interesting and it's a productive way of procrastination, I've been studying for the biology exam. And now I understand the topics much more than before, but there are still topics that I need to review, I will do them tomorrow with a detailed review. I've already sent the email asking Dr. Carmona - his wife - if I can attend his course as an audit. Today I've been very productive, and I also relaxed with the Simpsons.

    Entry: To be honest, I don't feel like writing in spanish, I think recently, my creativity or ability to say things or explain my thoughts in an efficient and simple way has decreased :(. I think it's also because I've been reading more- the book is very interesting and when I read it, I lose my sense of time. I can schedule my classes now! I met dr mina and she told me that it's possible to have a class without having to pay or do homework - audit a class. Ethan and leia already knew about the concept but I didn't!! I'm going to email the teacher tomorrow to ask if I can do it!! I hope she says yes.. I've also started tracking my calories! With hansel of course, I can't wait to work out tomorrow! I love the gym so much and I love my routine!! I'm going to call lyrik tomorrow to show him his new place, I hope he likes it, after that, I have my beatsaber contest woop woop, I think we're going to win, I'm hopeful. Or and I found a new podcast and it's pretty fun and funny. Now I want to read the Bible and sleep!! I need to rest more! Recently, Ben has seemed more tired and busy, I want to help him find a way to manage his time and gain more free time, tomorrow we also have our exam, I have studied but not much. I believe in myself and I hope God helps me.

    Entry: It rained a lot, and it's cold. I don't have much to say, one thing that cheered me up is the last episode of the simpsons, the parody of death note and bobs burgers appears in the episode!!! How exciting. Tomorrow I will start tracking my calories with hansel because he wants to gain weight. Happy Halloween, I didn't come out as ralph and his costume of said :(, in the udm bookstore, they sell manga! I wanted to buy mha ultra instinct but I decided that it's better that I don't buy it. I also read a lot of the labyrinth of the spirits or and I played chess and won a few games

    Entry: We didn't go to the restaurant, but next week, we're going to a Japanese restaurant! I can't wait!! I'll try some fancy ramen xD. I played roblox, and I had a lot of fun, the game ran smoothly, even though my computer gets hot ;-; I worked on my portfolio a bit more, and tried to fix some bugs in my quotes site code, it worked, but there are still bugs I need to fix, I'll leave that for me in the future. I played bone lab, it's interesting, and I've finally found a way to continue the game. Hmmm, I worked on the study guide for the religion class exam, and I edited my essay. I also watched a lot of simpsons episodes and summer time rendering

    Entry: Today I started the day feeling pretty unproductive, but I didn't want to feel that way, so I decided to cook something - I cooked split pea soup, it wasn't that great, but it was enough for me. Afterwards I finished the online recordings of dr grabowski and took notes, I'm going to watch more videos on the topics I don't understand tomorrow. I also did high knewton, and I even did more than necessary, because now, I don't have to do high knewton by Monday or Tuesday, there's one that doesn't work, I'll tell you on Monday. I started the essay for religion class, Ed a very rough draft, but I'll work more on it tomorrow to improve it! I'll send it to you later, hopefully I can send it to you before the end of the month. I also fixed a problem with my .portfolio site!! And it only took two lines of code, well - two because I deleted two lines xD, and now it works!!! I'm going to add and refine the site tomorrow. I bought bonelab! I just tried to add that purchase to my quotes site, but I think I broke something because I can't scroll on the site, I'll fix it if I remember! If not, I'll remember in the future and do it then. I played bonelab and it was pretty interesting, I hit the wall with my knuckles! The vr controller still works, but my nail hurts a bit. Now I want to sleep, I was pretty productive, oh I have to message yaheia and ask if she can send me her notes! I won't do it tomorrow, I have to do things in priority, I don't know if that sentence makes sense ;-;. I started a new anime - summertime rendering, I like it, but I don't love it, and my thighs are really sore!

    Entry: I was talking to Leia Andre and Ethan but now I'm about to sleep, I wasn't too busy today, I'm planning my schedule for next semester, and I like my classes! I want to take a Spanish class!! But it will mean that I will have 19 hours of credits, but in reality, it will only be 16 hours. I also saw a bird - a pigeon - hurt ;( . I didn't do anything, so, that I should have done :( Now to start with the most fun part of the day, in the biology lab, our group did a project, "project" or study and our goal was to find out if there will be a difference between basketballs, and soccer balls. Then we had to play basketball and soccer, and it was so so fun!!!! First we played basketball and I took pictures, then, I found out that there is a yoga room!!!!!??? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, and there were yoga cubes, mats, mirrors!! How wonderful, I should join a yoga class in the future! Then Leone and Natalia stayed to do the swabs, and I went out with this girl, I can't remember her name, and we played soccer outside, trying to make a game with her. Then when we came back, we did yogaball or bssketballga xD, we did some yoga and she told me that she was flexible :D, and I told her that she was flexible :D i've done yoga in the past. then we laid down and threw the basketball to each other like a game xD. leone was telling natalia how many people he's slept with, and first he said more than one, then just one, i don't care much and i don't think it's worth writing, but i think he was lying, it's possible that i'm not right and that he has slept with someone, but i doubt it, i really doubt it. but there's something else i've wanted to tell you about, while i was lying with her, i felt a little scared, a fear of not being able to have or imagine a relationship with her, you know? The fear of having someone like her, and maybe better, and not being able to go out with her? oh it's kind of confusing, i'll probably forget that fear, and it would probably be for the best because there are many sources of possibilities for that feeling and i don't want to investigate any further xd

    Entry: I was reading the last book in the forgotten cemetery book series, and I couldn’t understand much of anything, well, I understood the context and what happened, but I couldn’t understand the specific words ;-; , it’s kinda demotivating :( Also I feel kinda bad that no one got on the SCP call xd. I had the call with the director of cybersecurity, and I had to get on the call in the car because my dad came home pretty late xd. I played a bit of beat saber, and worked on the LCL website. I’m almost done with the lyrik website! This winter break, am I taking a class – film study? I hope it’s interesting. I’M EXCITED, Simpsons is getting a Death note parody and I can’t wait!! To be honest, there’s not much else to say, I didn’t do anything spectacular or different. Well it was pretty productive today. I guess there are always days like that, I don’t do much, but it’s not like I didn’t do anything.

    Entry: Why not? I feel great. I just found out that I can use casting on oculus with my Microsoft edge browser!! How cool!! Today I think I accomplished a lot, but I also think that I didn’t do too many challenging things. For example, I left my headphones at home, I only took one with me, without the case. Oops, I still need to play sky! But yeah, I didn’t understand some things in calculus class, so I watched the videos and tried to redo the problems to improve my knowledge and now, I think I can do it easily! Well, not easily, but I can understand it more. I talked to Ben and told him that I lifted 225 free for 5 reps and he was surprised, I don’t know why xD, I didn’t do the deadlift today, and I think I’ll replace it with pullups. Hmm what else do I have to say? I spoke to Dr. Carmina about Google Earth Engine and he recommended that I read (I use the imperfect subjunctive tense because it happened in the past and it is subjunctive) articles and studies on the subject to see what people say about it, I have read a little, but not much. I don't have much more to tell you, tomorrow will be a great day, I will learn more Greek too.

    Entry: Hello hello, how are you? My back still hurts!! I think it got worse when I did the deadlift!! Tomorrow, I'm not going to do it :(, I have to find an exercise to replace it. But speaking of exercise, I did work out today, breast day, and I enjoyed it a lot, I lifted 225 for 5 reps, next week, I'll lift 235!! I also worked on lyrik's site, and now, I don't hate the site lol, I like it, I like it a lot, I think there's something I need to add, but I like it the way it is, and I hope she likes it. I haven't worked much on dr qian's site because we don't have much to do anymore, then I worked on LCL, when I finished the registration functionality, I'll start with the real site!!! Or and I think I forgot to say. I want to take a class during winter break, movie study, I don't know, maybe it will be an interesting class, and I won't have to take it during the semester. I'm still thinking of an idea to pursue with google earth engine but I can't think of ANYTHING, tomorrow I'll go to office hours from dr Carmona and I think I will ask him there, because when I think of something, I think the answer will be obvious, and I want to do something that will really help people. Ehhh today is diwali xD, I don't have much more to say, I felt a bit bored. Tomorrow I think we will have another test in the data structures class. O and the days of mischief have started in sky. Now I'm leaving

    Entry: I went to the synagogue with ben!! It was a pretty weird experience at first, but the people there were really nice and I had fun. Afterwards, I worked, not much, but I worked on the lyrik site, I still don't love it. But I like it a lot more than before!! I finished duolingo in spanish, and I'm going to try to finish everything in legendary mode. I also finished mob psycho. I read the mha manga. I played a little sky, and I studied for biology class. I want to speak moress. But I want to sleep even moress. Bye

    Entry: I'm pretty exhausted!! It's been a long week lol, but I had a good time. I have to go to synagogue tomorrow with ben, I still feel a little unsure because I haven't confirmed it with my mom, I'll do it when I get home. I think I did really bad on the calculus test, really bad, but what can I do :(, I can't change the past, maybe I'll retake the test, or I'll do the project,, take things one step at a time, and you'll find your way. Now I know that I'm really really really hungry and I want to eat something sweet xd. I read the AOS chapter - the religion class book- he gave the tests back and I got 98/100, I also got 10 points on today's test, so I feel less worried. I have to stay strong, I can really relax on Sunday!! But now, the week isn't over yet, well no, I want to believe that it's over!! Although I still have some things that I need to do, I don't have to go to school - which means that I have a lot of free time, so I'll try to work more on the lyrik site, I like it, but I don't love it, I want to surprise her!!! I'll also work on the project, I haven't been able to prioritize it like before, but I don't have to anymore working on the biology powerpoint, i still have to watch videos in biology class but he hasn't uploaded the videos. Andy told me something yesterday that i notice more and more now, when i judge someone on any topic, i'm also judging myself, because i don't want to be a hypocrite, like i was saying, now i can't say or think things that are about the things i judge other people on xd MY MOTHER IS SLEEPING AT HER WORKPLACE, i just heard my father, and now i feel a little more relaxed!! That lifted my spirits! Oh i haven't worked out, tomorrow i'll play thrill of the fight or something ssi

    Entry: I'm talking to ben right now, he's a little sad because we had the data structures test, I got 50.5 points/50 and he got 42.5 points, and he's feeling down, I'm trying to cheer him up. I hope it works. I admitted that I'm a little jealous of him. When it comes to his work ethic, and stuff like that. I'm trying to convince him not to focus on just school and homework. But actually, that's not what I want to tell you, I mean that!!! IT SNOWED TODAY, SO EXCITED, now winter is coming >;), tomorrow I'll try to enjoy the day, I'm feeling pretty excited for the calculus and religion test. And the poster for the symposium. Tomorrow will be a good day. O and I played Sky with Polly, and it turns out I had fun finding map shrines with him!! Sky is not about candles or cosmetics, but friends that I can share with them.

    Entry: Oh oh oh I almost forgot to write here, I was thinking in Spanish because I saw mild on Sky and we chatted for a while, I was really happy to see her because I want sky to be more about friends and less about cosmetics, I think I'm restarting my love for the game now, if you know what I mean. I was really busy today. But I accomplished a lot, I have a lot to do, but I know I can do everything, and I'm not worried about it much. I actually feel relaxed??? I don't know why lol, maybe I'm just happy or content because I know I can face anything the world throws at me. I'm a little worried about the religion class test. I still have to tell my parents about the religious site visit with ben - this weekend hmm. I think that's it, I'm sleepy and I want to sleep tomorrow I'll see you Something funny happened, a guy and his girlfriend were kissing in the library lol

    Entry: Oh so many things happened today, first, I'll start with the start of my day, I woke up, thank god, and realized that today is the first day of the new season on sky, EEE! I like the new cosmetics, no, better said, I love them! I bought the adventure pass, I spent ten dollars, but I think it was worth it. Then I went to college and as always, I went straight to the gym, and you won't believe it, today, TODAY, the seventeenth of October, I bench pressed 225lbs for three reps!! I felt, and even now I feel very proud, I know that I can push myself very hard, and my goal is, when I'm twenty, I want to be able to bench press 405 freestyle, and, and maybe 450lbs in the squat. I think I can do it, I'm going to do it!! I feel very very refreshed now, I think I've found my love for lifting again! Lifting, and now I want to watch more videos on how I can improve my training :D. Then I had calculus class, and I’m taking the test on Wednesday, well, I’ll take it on Thursday, I want to study a little bit more, tomorrow I’ll ask her some questions, but it seems like I already understand what she’s going to ask us, or so I hope, I can do it, I’m confident, but I don’t want to be too confident, so when I’m in the library tomorrow, I’ll use that time to study more and more!! I think I’ll have a lot of free time too. Hmm, about Andre, I talked to Andy about it, and he asked me some interesting questions, questions that I need to think about more. It’s something I don’t want to feel!! And it’s something I need to control, at least I think I realized that now, I feel that way because I’m trying to stop judging people, so now, I see and notice when I do it a lot more than before, it’s a possibility, but I have to ask myself some hard questions, and I love a challenge don’t I >:). After that, I decided to work on the project, and now I don’t have many things to do, I need to find, or use google trandlate to translate the site into chinese, but I also need to see if it’s possible to use it in chinese, I hope so!!! O! Something big, lyrik contacted me and I told her that I still want to work on her site with her, so I think tomorrow, or at least before the end of this week, I will design some designs for her site, and I will tell her how much money she will pay me, I think 100 dollars is enough, I don’t know if it’s too much money, but I also don’t know if it’s too low, I’ll see what she tells me. And I haven’t been able to use google earth engine today, but I have some ideas that I want to realize, and when I have more free time, I will use it. Now that I’m talking here, I feel very very good, I also worked on our poster for the biology lab, and I feel very very proud, O O AND I ALMOST FORGOT TO SAY, I want to do a road trip, I’ll tell you more in the future

    Entry: Today, today. A day and a half xd. Today was one of those days where I’m not really worried, but I need to do one or two important things, and I can’t stop thinking about them!! I had the beat saber contest and, well, the other team was actually bothering me because they played in d1 before, and one of their teammates was slowing us down a lot! How annoying. I also got the scp call, it didn’t take long, and I didn’t hate it xd. I ate lots and lots of ice cream and had some cake and a big dinner, tomorrow I’m going to try to lift 215 for six reps, I also played roblox with hansel xD. But yeah, he motivated me and I want to talk to the guy I always see at the gym at eight, well, usually when I’m there. I want to be friends and he can - he csn spot me- while I’m doing the bench press. For calculus class. I hope we have the test! Because I really don't want to do the project, Simon and Andre want to do it, I don't understand them, maybe I doubt my abilities to do something new, something that hasn't been taught to us, and also I won't like it if Andre works with Andrew, oh what am I saying!! Is there a part of me that has great displeasure? Against him, do I hate him? No, well I don't know!!! Why do I have these feelings, I don't know! I'll try to think more about it to avoid going crazy xd. Now it's very late and I'm going to sleep#

    Entry: Hello hello, how are you, are you okay? Well I don't know how I feel now, but today, I've been experiencing old feelings, and most of those feelings are about a boy, a boy who oh, at the beginning, I liked, and even now, but more and more I, eee. It's not fair to talk about him here, he hasn't done anything wrong, and I'll just be yelling in an empty palace. But I have to say that sometimes he bothers me. I don't want to say he's lazy, but sometimes, yes! Yes he is! And he always talks about how his environment affects him. Oh, I'm not going to talk about this anymore because I know it's not solving anything, and I've decided that I'm not going to judge anyone. He lives like this because he wants to live like this, I can only control my life! Changing the subject, I practiced beat saber with logan to prepare for our contest tomorrow! I have the call from scp and you already know my feelings about it. I played roblox a little to relax, and it worked! I can play without problems, I watched the first episode of chainsawman. And it's great!! I really like it. I restarted the Java project, this time with the computer playing against the user, and I think it works! It's not a wonderful piece of code, but it works, my legs hurt from leg day yesterday! My nose is stuffed, and I hate it!!!

Tomorrow, I'll study more, and I'll practice more with Google earth engine. I ate ice cream xD

    Entry: At first, I was gonna say horrible or bad, and I know, I know, I'm typing in english, but I'm gonna continue in Spanish after this, just got to get this off my chest. Today started out pretty great, I was still feeling pretty jumpy/nervous, maybe because i filled my head in with the idea that I'm super busy when I'm really not, but i read part of the book andy gave me, did a pretty good.leg workout!! Gonna feel it tomorrow :D, then I headed to calc class which was also pretty good, I'm starting to understand the idea of differential equations more    Then religions class hit and it kind of bummed me.out because we had a quiz and I think I missed two questions, made me feel pretty bad, now it's not as bad, I messed up one of the questions about dharma vs sutra, and I also mixed up scriptures with canon, If I was to rationalize it, I'll say that both answers have a degree of correctness to them, but it may be due to misunderstanding the question, maybe I'm just compensating and bringing out my inner ben logic, but I guess it's true. Now , or at least before I delved really deep into it, and even kind of now it feels pretty dumb. Not gonna invalidate my feelings, wow I really want to get this kind of expression and flow in Spanish, but I cant let that one thing ruin my day essentially, I had a stress moment thinking of getting a b in religions class, I'm deciding that one. It wouldn't be the end of the world at all, two, I'm putting effort in the class, and will continue to put more effort into the future. I can always talk to dr hibbard about it and he can let me know ways for me to improve. His office hours! So I'm not going to let that bother me, actually it didnt really as I'm thinking about it, today has been full of good vibes, I got a 44 on the biology exam, same as last time and I was expecting to do worse! We didnt have biology lab and turned in our abstracts, I finsihed two knewton altas   Actually something else happened, so I went to seed and the dude was talking about his company motionly - future me, you got his business card, use it! - and oriekaose was asking questions. Questions I was thinking about but also some admittedly good questions, it made me feel kind of awkward since I usually.pride myself in asking good questions and getting compliments about it, but thinking back about it, it seems like I was more focused on extrinsic reward? Wow I really feel like I'm overrationalizjng it lol, but I guess when I get to a point where I feel so confident in myself and my abilities that I dont have to worry about how others perceive me, something I've been getting better at, some days much better than others, but it's a constant progress and it's something I'm learning to deal with.  Apart from that, im in Briggs now cause the library was closed LOL, played an over the board chess game with andre and he was winning, but he threw the game, I believe I'm only winning technically cause or luck, not gonna think about it xd, my chess skills are enough where they are now.  Beat saber tournament scheduled for 8pm on sunday woop woop!!!! All things considered, today has been a revealing day to test my.limits and how I deal withstress, this makes things so much better ,  OH AND NOT ONLY THAT, I got accepted into using igoogle earth engine, it's something I want to become.proficient at. when I get home, I'll do some work for the project, maybe restudy some calculus content by watching past videos. Maybe play some beat saber ooo,  tomorrow, I'll start reworking the java project and talk to ms Vanita or sth about our meeting cause no one responded!

    Entry: Quiero decir algo pero es bastante tarde, lo voy a decir en Inglés porque es algo que me molestarme conmigo mismo.   It's about how I feel when other people do things that I want to do, wow it feels weir talking here in english, but things like the research thingy, I feel weird doing it after ethan did it, even though he has been pushing me to do it, but I even feel more weird thinking about andre doing it! And I get some sort of weird comfort knowing, or thinking i know that he wouldnt go along with it cause hes gonna be working at fford or sth like that. Ugh its frustrating. Its something I've gotten much better at of course, but it's still there and it irks me. I shouldn't be bothered by what other people are doing as it doesnt affect my life, that's not true love! True love isnt jealous or envious, and thats something I want to and will strive to achieve, I imagine I could approach it by filling my heart so much with the word of God that the thoughts dont even appear, but I dont think that's a fully pragmatic solution from the getgo and I imagine that being able to recognize and snuff out the thoughts will be a stepping stone into the first scenario.   I want to say a lot mpre.but I dont think itll serve me well now, maybe later, i watched a buncha new simpson episodes lol

    Entry: Today, I had a lot of fun :), I was pretty busy, but it was a kind of occupation that gives me pleasure, because I feel like doing it. I had the meeting with Ethan andre and dr Carmona, I asked him if he had done a study with birds, and he said yes, but actually, it wasn’t really about birds. We went to Bucharest, and the food was delicious. I enjoyed my workout routine too! Tomorrow is my leg day, and it’s great because I don’t have the biology lab, so I can rest a little bit. We’re almost done with the paper, but we need to make some changes, it shouldn’t take us too long. I had the meeting with dr qian, and she told me that she wants me to translate the site in mandarin! So I have to look for a discord server with mandarin speakers, and I’ll see if someone can help me xD, I’m pretty excited, and I couldn’t stop smiling, because I like lai dea, and I don’t know, it makes the site more real, or professional. Now when I get home I'll try to finish our poster with my group, aaand I'll email the teacher who did the discussion. You have a turtle!!

    Entry: Oh tomorrow, tomorrow will be a very busy day- what a weird word, it means busy. But I need to plan some things, first, as normal, I will work out, I think, no, I know that I can reach 225 pounds- pounds- on the bench press!! I know I can do it!!!! After that, I will finish the anatomy of the sacred, and if I have more time, I will continue the biology lab paper, if I don't have enough time, I will do it at night. After that, I will go to calculus class, after that, I will go to java class, today, I found out that I had not written code to pause the IBT test but I have already done it, it took me maybe 3 hours, but during that time, I was trying to optimize the images, and I think I was successful!!! Now I like it, no, I love the way the site looks, I am glad that it made me change the way the site looked. Hmm, I have the seminar with that person for extra credit in religion class, I have my meeting with dr qian before that, and I have another meeting with dr carmona and ethan and andre. I hope everything goes well. In short, I think tomorrow will be a long day, but I can do it and survive, I don't feel too overwhelmed, I've also registered my team for the beat saber contest, and the other team contacted me, we're going to schedule a match very soon, and we don't need score saber, it actually seems pretty easy to plan everything. Tomorrow. When I have free time, I'll schedule our match. Also today I remembered my dreams and they were very funny, today I'll also remember and write down my dreams. Now I'm going to sleep. Also, it's raining, how calm.

    Entry: really, i mean i feel rad, but no, at least at the beginning of the day, i felt really rad, i was really relaxed, my brother was sleeping and i was writing pars code in ds and java project, and i finished both projects ,that made me feel really productive, afterwards i made a wonderful pasta breakfast xd. My back hurts more than yesterday!! I shouldn't have jinxed it- jinxed xd. i did some reading, i also read some from the lucid dreaming book, for biology class, we sent our abstract for study, "study" xd, they have a lot of faith! But i think our project is useless, quite useless, very useless :*), we don't have a long universe, universe means sample size, how interesting, and our topic is not concrete. Well, we already did it, and i like my team, but we are going to change teams very soon ;-; i want to learn arabic! I don't know why, i like greek, and i want to learn italian, but i need to focus on a language :(. It's very late now and i want to sleep, ben needs help with his project and andre is studying calculus, if you haven't noticed yet, well of course you have, it's me ;-;, but i'm trying to use less articles because i realized that i've been using them too much. Also dr carmona speaks spanish! and i want to talk to him!! He invited me- with andre and ethan, well, he invited ethan but i'm accompanying them because i helped them, and i want to talk to him about his studies, and if i can speak spanish with him xD. We're going to bucharest! And i'll see how it goes, i will do it after my meeting with dr qian!! I played beat saber - practiced some d2 maps, and a little bit of les mills, i really need to work on my cardio ;-;

    Entry: Today, I was very productive!! I wrote a lot of code and I got my new computer, it has a wonderful screen, it gets very hot but it's not horrible and I can handle it. I'm glad that hansel is okay, I finished most of the tasks I needed to do in the project, when dr qian answers my emails, I'll be able to finish everything. I'll also be able to improve the site and make it faster!!! I need to look for tricks to improve the speed of a website. Other than that, I didn't eat much. But I also didn't work out :(, I'll play beat saber and a little bit of les mills tomorrow. I don't want to play thrill of the fight because it will exhaust my muscles. My back doesn't hurt anymore!! Or not too much, by Thursday, everything will be healed. I read more about the presentation we're going to give in the biology lab, it's not complicated, but sometimes I feel a little stressed, or overwhelmed but that feeling goes away very quickly. If I feel nervous, it's because I care and I don't want to disappoint or fail my classmates! And I'm not going to do that, I'll do my best and I have faith that God will deal with me O and I lowered both rem and ram in sofi today

We went to the office and shopping, I listened to some Greek lessons on Language Transfer, and I really like the language, it's very similar to Spanish, and I like the sounds of the language. Now I'm watching Spanish videos to practice and have a little fun, tomorrow. When I get my new computer, I'll try to finish the data structures project. Wish me luck.

    Entry: Today, I was pretty productive, I had the scp call, daniel couldn't bring the computer so he's going to do it tomorrow. I hope he comes after 4 or something because we're going to a law firm tomorrow!! To celebrate my brother's birthday. I updated my portfolio and the anime search site, I want to redo the site, I think I'll do it during Christmas break. I also finished, or am almost finished with the Java project, I found a wonderful way to make the site work. It's about the tic tac toe game. Other than that, I didn't do much today. I played beat saber and passed light it up and 100 dollar bills again with ease. Well. Relatively. We applied for the contest but we need to do more things! It's good that logan is helping me because I feel a little overwhelmed. I told dr hill that I couldn't come with him and I went to the thing they're doing on Tuesday. And I feel much more relaxed! I can relax without feeling guilty. I played sky for a bit, and watched some episodes of mob psycho. Now I want to sleep. See you. No. I don't want to just talk about my day. I want to talk about my feelings and the accomplishments I've made day by day. Today, I was thinking about how lucky I am to have a friend like Ben. I've always wanted a friend that I can talk to about exercises, and my future dreams. Sometimes, he overestimates me, but in my eyes, he's a wonderful friend and deserves everything he wants. I'm leaving now!!!

    Entry: I finally passed 100 dollar bills on beat saber!!!! I was feeling so excited, and I recorded a video with audio!!! I was so exhausted xd. But then, I decided to start the java project, and I haven’t finished it, but I’ve made a lot of progress, and I don’t have that much to do, despite finding a way to solve the algorithm ;-;. Tomorrow, I hope I’ll get my new computer!! I have the scp meeting, but it’s online. I need to tell my parents about the thing with dr hiill!!! Ughhh I know they’re not gonna say no, I’ll tell my dad tomorrow, and then I’ll tell my mom. I don’t like feeling like this. I’m also going to ask them if I can have money to give to daniel instead of a gift card. Oh I didn't play sky today :(, I haven't been playing it much recently. And I haven't talked much with the other people on the server. The biology test didn't go bad. But it didn't go great, I'll leave that in God's hands. In the biology lab, we're going to do a poster presentation. Edim a little excited but also a little nervous, but I guess this is a good thing. I'm talking to ben right now and tomorrow, I'll finish my project, and write more code for the project. Oh I need to add more hours. And I need to update my anime search site!! They changed the api, and I need to update it, it shouldn't take long, I'm leaving now, bye

    Entry: I feel good, I feel good. I have the career fair tomorrow. Today, some interesting things happened. I woke up very very early, at or around 5, and I didn't want to go back to sleep because I felt so refreshed. So I stayed in bed, the religion teacher has covid, and Ethan said he might have covid too, I hope not. I did cardio- the bike, and I read the book Andy gave me when I did it. Tomorrow, I think I'll wear a formal shirt, and I don't want to ;-;, but it means I'll look very professional. I also printed out some copies of my resume, I'm not applying to any companies, but it will, or I hope it will be a useful experience. I can't wait to get my new computer!! And my meeting on Saturday is now online!!!! So exciting :D, I don't have to leave the house. I think I need more help or practice in understanding when I should use the definite articles- a, an, the. I just need to practice more. Oh and I played beat saber, and now, I don't have much to do on the project!! I fixed some bugs, and I feel more relaxed, I should finish everything I need to do before the end of the week, but I'll need more time to make sure all the functionality works as it should.

Today, I changed some exercises in my wednesday routine because my back still hurts, and now, I like it!! I like it more than before, and I think I can keep doing it!! I’m going to try really hard. Andy gave me a book and I’m going to look at it today, and I almost finished 100 fucking bills on beat saber! And there’s rush e version 2 and it’s really good, but I can’t approve of it :*). I showed off my new haircut, and I haven’t formed an opinion yet, it’s not amazing, I would have preferred him not to cut the side part of my hair but I can’t change the past, so what can I do xd. I’m still really excited to see and use it!! Today, I didn’t write as much code as yesterday, but I was able to finish some things I wanted to do, and I did them with ease. I've told my mother about my meeting this week, but I haven't told her about the career fair yet, which I'm going to attend. Right now, I'm not too tired, but I don't have much else to say. I'll see you tomorrow then.

    Entry: Oh I need to go to sleep, but oh, I've been working on the project, and I've made a lot of progress! But there's also one big problem, the site is slow when I reduce the wifi speed. I've tried to increase the speed, but when I do, it just makes the start up time faster, but still, when I use the app, it's pretty slow and I have to wait until they show the screenshots;-;. After I finish the necessary functions, I'll look for ways to increase the speed of the site. But I shouldn't focus too much on that!! I've done a lot, there are still changes I need to make, but most of the changes won't take too long to make. I just need to ask dr qian about a few things and I won't have to do too much during the week. I've spent almost five hours working on the site this weekend!! On a different topic, I finished cyberpunk!! And I started a new anime called talentlesss nana, and it's really interesting!! Or and I played beat saber and now my shoulder hurts ;-;. Tomorrow is my chest day, and I’ll try to lift weights like normal, I’ll see how things go, now I need to rest to regain my strength ;-;. I ate a lot too, but I don’t care, well, I didn’t eat much, I ate enough xd. Tomorrow, I’ll ask ben about some questions I have about the religion exam, and I want to see his progress with his game. I haven’t been able to work on my LCL site and it makes me feel a little sad because I want to continue it, I also have spline that I want to learn but I haven’t used it much lately ;-; and I know it’s my fault, but not in a bad way, it’s not a priority, if that was the case, I’ll find a way to do it. I think, no, I'm going to work and make sure I get an A in calculus two, so far, I understand the important things, but maybe I'll see dr archey at his office hours, read the bible, maybe a little bit of the lucid dreaming book because I haven't practiced my reality testing and I don't remember my dreams like I used to :(

I also played thrill of the fight and studied for religion class, tomorrow I'm going to finish my studying, I'll fix some things for the project, so I don't need to work so much next week. I also did some knewton high homework. I don't want to feel overwhelmed this next week, that's why I'm trying to do a lot of work, but I've also been a little lazy, well, very lazy xd. I found a new series called fugget about it, and its funny, my back still hurts me, at first, i forgot about it, but when i was boxing, it came back :(, and i think its worse than before. Or and i saw that next season on sky, aurora’s season, we’re going to have her song on the music papers, like runaway, and i’m dying to play it. I’m almost done with prisoner of heaven, it’s a pretty small book!! I think next, i’ll start the book about the greek myth, i can’t remember the name. Speaking of greek, i started greek lessons at language transfer, now i want to learn it, i know i know, i haven’t even learned to speak spanish yet, but i still want to learn it, of course, i prefer to learn more about italian, but i think greek can open a box of opportunities when it comes to finding out word origins and i find that knowing the origin of words fascinates me, and it makes learning the meaning of the word easier. All in all. Today has gone by really really fast, I couldn't use immersed because it didn't work, I think when I'm in battery saving mode, it doesn't work, but I need to test my hypothesis. Some loud cars are driving outside xd. Because of boxing, the spaces between my elbows hurt, I hope it doesn't affect me too much. And that it gets fixed before Monday. Now I want to sleep, and I want to buy a new computer!!

    Entry: I felt like re-reading my posts from last year, and I saw that exactly one year ago, I talked to Ethan's brother and I felt that creating websites (eech) can't change people's lives or help them, but now, I have a view, maybe a little more prejudiced or biased- but now I like creating websites! It's a challenge and I have to think about how to do what I want to do and do it in an efficient way. I've also discovered that yes, websites can change a lot of people's lives! Whether it's people with big companies or small businesses, there are sites like Stack Overflow, Dribble, sites designated by different communities and sites that help people in those communities. It's very unlikely that I'll work with a huge site, but you can say that I'm doing that now with my project with Dr Qian. Websites do much much more than just display data, if I want to show something to the world. I do/can do it with a website, and while I understand my point of view in the past, I can't use my hands to make something that will improve the lives of people in my immediate community, but I can make my life, or someone's life more comfortable. Sometimes I feel like that, a little sad and lost, but now, I think that's normal, and I can use it as a challenge to learn new things. If I feel like it, I can increase my skills to create a website that does much much more. It's something that will continually change, in the past, I thought like that, a year ago!! I didn't know that time has passed so much, but yes, I am always learning.

    Entry: Today, I was really really busy, I didn't even do any exercise because my brother didn't go to school, and we left the house at nine 9:30 ;-;. And I left school at five, right after biology lab.. Random memory, I just remembered from the OA dances - the series on Netflix, I can still do some parts of the dance, but I can't do the last part. I had a test in biology and religion class, and to be honest, I didn't do bad, not bad at all, on the religion test, I didn't read chapter five- the chapter we should have read, but I can't change the past, it's too late and I want to sleep, AAAAAAAAAAA I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THE YOUTH ADVISROY COUNCIL EEE, ouch uhjugh ugh whyyyy, I don't want to do it next weekend :(((((. How awful, well, I shouldn't have that attitude, I like the people there, and I like that we can do something important, and we have the money to do it, so I shouldn't worry. Tomorrow, I'll study for the religion test and try to write more code in the project because I have a lot a lot to do, I just spent almost two hours adding borders, I don't feel like writing coherent Spanish xd. The socket, well, my computer wasn't charging, and it barely works. I want a new computer. Many things have happened today, most of them being unforeseen, but they are unforeseen and I can't change it, so I'm not going to spend more time on them.

After data structures - we talked about Linkedlists - I had my meeting with dr qian, I have a lot to do, but I think I should be able to finish everything I need to do, before the week after next week. MY BACK STILL HURTS, aaaaa . O and dr qian gave me some sweet cookies, she is very very nice!! I am glad that I am working with her. Tomorrow, I will try to relax more, I have not been able to read as much as before, o and I filled out - fill out, re fill out - fill? - a form to register for something that is about computer science Ed week? Mrs. kalisha recommended me, and I like to think that she thinks of me, or at least, she considers that I have contributed something, because the people who were there have done more more complex and interesting things. Tomorrow I will continue my routine, I have a test in religion class, biology, and I have my biology lab, hopefully everything goes well. Other than that, I don't think I have much to do (I just discovered that I need to use the subjunctive tense! Because it's a doubt, "I don't think so", ), tomorrow, I will read chapter five of the anatomy of the sacred and review my notes, and read more biology. I have to study more about moles, now, what I think is we receive 1 mole when we soak - soak- a solute (and we have solvent (water), and the solution - the product, ) in a liter of water, but I have to investigate more about it. Or, my Disney subscription ended yesterday :( Now I will read the bible and a bit of the prisoner of heaven, I have recently restarted duolingo in Spanish, it has more complex vocabulary, like take off - take off, land - land. People are still asking me if I am selling Lucy, but no! Someone even offered me three hundred tickets!!

    Entry: Nothing spectacular happened today, duolingo reminded me of my lack of extensive vocabulary, and my mediocre grammar :(. But actually, something interesting happened, because I had an interesting dream, it was about sky, it was like I was playing it with a first person point of view, but that's not the most interesting thing that happened today, I downloaded a really good card. Almost twenty people have asked me about the card!! It's lucy, from edgerunners. I tried to watch a few episodes of the anime and it's good! I like it, not love it so much. I like the story and the characters and the music, but I have to keep watching it. Today, I was able to finish the identification test in the project, and it didn't take long, actually, it only took fifteen minutes? More or less xD, I'm ready to show it to dr qian tomorrow, I hope he likes it. Oh today I didn't do much exercise, I brought my vr to campus but we couldn't do anything because beatsaber didn't work. We're going to keep trying, but I've sent an email to Bruce to give me the necessary permissions- Josh is also playing with us!! How exciting. Eeee, what else happened today, oh I have a test in Java class tomorrow, I don’t have to study much, my lower back still hurts, but I think it won’t affect me much when I exercise. I’m still reading Prisoner of Heaven, and it’s very interesting, but a little confusing, because different stories happen at different stages, and I need to think about who’s who and who did what in relation to the characters during that stage, I don’t know if it makes sense, but I want to buy a new computer too!! A Samsung Galaxy book pro 360. I think it’s a wonderful computer.

I'm bringing my VR to campus tomorrow. Today, dr mina was crying in class :(, I really hope she is okay, she could finish the basics of the new test in the project, and I like it because she used a new method to do it, and I like that it works, although it still has its little problems. I love to exercise in the morning, I have more free time!! And I love it. I need to study calculus more, now I understand the theory of the topic. But some parts of the solutions are hard for me. Apart from everything I just told you, I don't have much to say, I sent an email to dr qian, and I think we scheduled- chedule- our meeting for next week. But I will ask him when he answers my email, I also had a call with ben and played sky with a foreigner, and it was very very relaxing, we played music and sat around the campfire.

    Entry: Today, I had a very awkward but helpful conversation with Andy from Cru. At first, we talked about the Bible. But we started talking about Fall Getaway and I told him about the relationship, and how I perceive my relationship with my parents, and my fear of talking to my parents about my daily events. I reaffirmed that this problem has many sources and roots, it can be my personality, or a desire not to be rejected, I can even say that there is a lack of trust, I mean, I mean sometimes, no, well, I don't think trust is the right word, I don't want to depend on them, you know, I like to do my tasks and chores without their interruption or advice. And now, I don't feel like going to Fall Getaway. He asked that I should pray and listen to what God tells me, and now I don't know if my doubts are going to disappear, it's like, oh I also need to do the Cru meeting tomorrow. But, oh I'm not really saying anything, I feel very tired. I worked out as normal, I wore a cap today! I dreamed about bees too

It's cold, not too much, but it's cold, and I felt very productive, I wrote and cleaned up the code for the project - I'm going to call it that way because it's hard to think of a perfect name for it. I watched a little bit of jjk's movie, but there's one thing that made my day wonderful, and it's about my vr, and an app that one of the fitness server recommended me, it's wonderful, I wrote some code with the vr, and I put a cold environment with snow, and it's wonderful because I felt cold. And my surroundings also seemed cold, I think I'll do it again tomorrow, after I wake up, I'll write more code, but I also want to do my data structures project, I'll do it tomorrow too, and I did my knewton alta homework today, they weren't hard. I want to change the subject a bit, I still have a hard time differentiating between the imperfect and preterite tense, and I want to travel to a Spanish speaking country to improve my skills of differentiating between the two. But in short, I love the season. And I almost forgot to say, I received my order - the adapter to use the pi-top, I used it without needing the adapter, but I still like having it, it works now and I'm glad it worked. I just watched another episode of she hulk, but as I was saying, in short, I love the cold, and I love that I've been able to relax, but also be productive.

    Entry: Today, I feel good, but weird, that’s why I put my excitement as insecure. Today I faced a new feeling, I think I’ve only felt it once in the past, like two or three years ago? And the resolved is still with me. Today, I went with hadi, leoney simón and their friends to the urban garden. I found someone who watches anime because I wore my deku clothes. First I want to say something, sometimes, I like this, but other times, I don’t like the color of my skin, I know, I know, don’t punish me xd, but yes, since I was a child, the dark color seems very, well, dark to me, I don’t know how to explain it, but well, I don’t need to explain it. Because I’m talking to myself. But yeah, that’s not the point of this entry, Hadi brought his vape, and he used it in the garden. To be honest, he’s very sneaky with it - sneaky means sneaky, and greed means greed- from the prisoner of heaven. Well I should start from the beginning, hadi has, or at least uses a nice car, ugh I don’t know why but every time I hang out with someone and learn more about them, I usually over analyze them!! I don’t know if it’s just a habit I like, I like to know the importance of other people in my life, and people like leone and hadi usually confuse me, because I don’t really know anyone like them! Ok, after a quick meditation session, I’ve decided that I’m not going to talk about them, because when I do, all I accomplish is judging them, and usually my opinions are either wrong or I lack the necessary information. I say all that, to say that, I’m not going to talk about other people anymore when I learn new information about them, it’s very entertaining, but it doesn’t help me, and what will help me is to enjoy the opportunities to talk to people from different backgrounds and new personalities, I don’t have to love them, but I do have to see and acknowledge their differences! I want this realization to stay with me in the future when I meet other people! So, deal, I'm not going to judge them. But today, I had a good time, I had fun in the garden, the food at tdr was great, I worked out, but my legs felt very tired, I just migrated the kids testing site from vue cli to vite, and I hope that by doing this, I will learn more about how vite works. And its advantages. Or and I played beat saber

I also want to use nuxt.js, or maybe vite, and that will mean I need to migrate the codebase. I don't know how to do that, but it's something I could do. Hmnm, I didn't exercise in the morning because we went to school at nine, and I had my calculus test, I made a mistake in one problem, but I can't change the past and I'm not going to worry about it. See you later

    Entry: I have a very strange feeling, I feel overwhelmed, but I don't know why. I guess there is something I want to say, but I don't know if I could explain it well in Spanish. Before I do, I just talked to Ben, I was in the library when he came, and we talked about our projects and plans for the future. Okay, I think what I feel is not a feeling of being overwhelmed (it's the same thing), it's not fear, is it about showing a foreigner a part of my personal life? Or something I love and I don't want other people to see? It's a strange feeling, because I have felt it, but now, I don't think it's about the normal causes of the feeling. I'll tell you all the information I have. Tomorrow I have to bring my VR to school - and of course, I don't want anything to happen to it, but I also don't want to have to tell my parents about esports and why I have to bring my VR to school, ughhh. I don’t want to ignore this feeling, but I feel like it’s not helping me much to talk about him, and maybe it’s better to ignore it, but maybe I should start trusting my senses, something is telling me that I shouldn’t bring him, and even now, I feel better thinking about the future that I can’t bring my vr, maybe it’s because I don’t trust logan, to be honest, I don’t really trust him, maybe what Ethan told me is influencing my decision, but I think it’s the right decision. Or maybe it could be that I don’t have all the information, and I’m worrying for nothing, but now that I think about bringing him, the weird feeling comes back. Now, I’ve decided that I’m not going to bring him tomorrow, but now it doesn’t work out for me. Well no, no. I’m not going to make a decision now. When I write here. at night. I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. I also did cardio today eoop woop, and I’ve studied and done a lot of my homework. And ugh I like talking to ben. Or maybe it's because I'm talking to someone other than André Ok edit i'm in the car with my dad and i'm gonna ask him if i can bring my vr with me tomorrow we'll see what he says and i'll tell you how it goes I've told him and he said well i don't know how to say it in spanish but essentially he said i can do whatever i want i don't have to tell my mom but it's possible that well it would be better to tell her I still don't know if i want to bring him when i think about logan that feeling comes back so i think he's the one i don't like and i don't have much to do tomorrow so maybe i'll go with ben or ethan or andre when i tell my mom i'll tell you my decision

    My mood Conflicted
    
    Entry: I'm going to use this emotion because I feel very disappointed in myself, why? Because I forgot about the anniversary of the fitness center, and there were magicians! I was in the library! But, I can't change the past, and it was raining, it's still raining with lightning, and I like it!. I talked to logan - the one from the esports club. And he told me that if I want to compete in beat saber contests, I can do it, and I want to do it. Because why not. I'm going to talk about the beginning of my day, I woke up, thank God, and I just ate two cornbreads, then I went to school. And I worked out. There were more people I wanted there. But I can't control it, I was sweating a lot 😭, and I tried to deadlift 265lbs but I couldn't do it, I'll try next week. Other than that, I had the class with dr Zhong. I'm not looking forward to my class with her- im not looking forward to, but it seems to be said like - i a not hoping for the arrival of... Since I started lifting weights in the morning, I've had more free time, and now I use it for studying. And I want to continue with my site, I really like the way it looks, and I want to continue coding it, I'm not sure that's a word, but shut up :(. I think tomorrow, I'll have a lot of free time, I'll work on the site then. Hmm, I still have the raspberry pi, but I can't use it without an hdmi cable, I've already bought one, but it'll arrive on friday, so I have to wait :(. Next semester, I really want to take a spanish class, I'M GOING TO DO IT EE, but it's so far five months ahead. Tomorrow, instead of doing my normal routine, I think I'll replace the day with cardio, and I'll go for a walk. Now I brush my teeth, and I'm going to sleep. See you tomorrow kid. O and I saw another dead bird

    Entry: I like it, today i played beat saber with logan, and i had a good time, i'm better than him at bs, and we're going to play echo vr in the future. I'm sleepy, and i haven't read much of the dream book, it's not a book i can read continuously, but now i'm reading prisoner of heaven, and i've already learned two words, showcase and heading. I also want to use the raspberry pi we have, but i need an hdmi cable. I'll try to use it to automate something, i don't know what i can automate yet, but there are a lot of options and i just need to be creative. I read one of the articles for biology lab. Ugh i want/need to study what we went over in data structures class. I'll do it tomorrow, speaking of tomorrow, we had calculus class online, OR and i worked out in the morning, and i really enjoyed it, i lifted 195lbs for 5 reps, and i almost failed twice!!! But i enjoyed it! I'm still writing code for my LCL project, and I like the way it looks, but I'm still doing the basics, tomorrow, I'll try to write more code and add firebase to the project. I like vite, but I prefer to use nuxt.

    Entry: I downloaded noomi! And today was pretty productive, I made the notes for the videos for biology lab, I also finished knewton high for calculus, and the weekly test for lab too. I did the programming class with ben, and afterward, we would add ethan to the call and chat with each other. Right now I'm listening to sky's new OST, and it's very relaxing, because a quick song just played, but yeah. It's not that hot, and I don't have much to say. Ahh I almost forgot to say, I didn't have to go to the scp place today!!!! I did it online, and I didn't need to talk much. Long story short, I was productive today, I just felt a little overwhelmed because of Sunnysideshop's code, and I realize, that doesn't excite me, it doesn't turn me on, I want to keep working on my site! On my project, or and I told my mom that dr qian has raised my salary, or and I broke half a dozen eggs :*). I also played beat saber today. Speaking of SSS, I don't know if I want to keep working on it, I can always leave the server 🤷‍♂️. But there's no need, there are new things to try! Like creating a very reusable component. To be honest, I feel overwhelmed, and a bit confused. I know I'll feel better tomorrow, and I should just sleep, so good night.

    Entry: I just finished titanfest! I had a great time with Evan, andre and andreh, and linu. I was enjoying myself so much!!!! I have a video xD. I also talked to michael, and he told me that he wants another muscled guy in the anime club, AND I WANT TO JOIN, I WANT TO SO BAD, but I can’t, because they do it during cru time!! And then, I have java, ughhh, maybe after cru - 1:45, I can join for maybe 10 minutes, oh I can’t, they do it in the library, and cru is in the engineer building, AAAAA. I’ll see what I can do, I like them. Now I’m going home, I had my religion and biology test, and I know that I passed two tests!!! They weren’t hard tests. I also did some exercise - leg day - and I enjoyed it a lot, I think I'll start doing some exercise as soon as I get home from school in the morning, the gym is empty and I can focus, if I do that, it'll mean I have more time to do my homework, talk to other people, or even eat and do my homework afterwards. I'll try it next week, and I'll let you know how it goes. What else do I have to say eeeeeehhh, OH OH OH OH OHO HIH. AAAAAA TODAY. More things happened, dr qian has increased my salary aaaaa, he pays me 18 dollars now. I just felt a little stressed, well, I just got a little overwhelmed, I don't know if that sentence makes sense or not, but it seems like it now. I have to work harder, but I already work a lot actually, as you know, but what it means is that now, I need to pay more attention to my code. And how do I write it, because you know, I've seen the code of sunny side shop, and they use tailwind with typescript with vue, and I can understand the code, but I feel like I can't write something like that, although actually, I think I can write something like that. I'll have to look at the code again to ask questions (not ask questions, ask questions!) I also saw a dead bird, and someone drew on the board in religion class. I have the SCP meeting tomorrow, but I don't want to do it face to face!!! I want to do it online, I have to ask ms vanita about it. I'm so thirsty. I'll tell her when I get home. I have more pictures, but there's a limit :*), I think buying the yearly plan of this app has been very helpful. o O I HAVE ANOTHER THING TO SAY, I think I was having a lucid dream, but I think it's more like an out of body experience. I don't know, I felt like I was leaving my body

    Entry: I have a lot to do tomorrow, but I'll leave it there, tomorrow. There's no reason to get upset and worry about things in the future. I couldn't read the lucid dreaming book today because I was studying for biology class, and I had a call with ben about the dr data structures project. Ethan invited andre and I to a meeting with a prospective student. We talked about our coops in the summer. Oh oh oh something's ticking me off a little bit, it's not a big thing, it's actually very small, but I want to say it because I want to get it off my chest - undrown, get off chest. Oh no it's not necessary. But I'll do it. It won't cost me anything, it won't affect me. You know, but this guy was talking to the prospective student about his coop, and he talked to him about learning three programming languages, html css and react. And you and I both know that he didn't learn anything, I'm being very blunt, but I can say that if I give him something to do in html, something easy, he won't be able to do it, and I don't mean that he's incompetent. But he usually says stuff to make himself feel smart. Do you understand me? THIS IS USELESS AAAAAAA. Hahaha it’s nothing important, but at least it’s a way to improve my spanish and talk about my day, oh he sent me a message xD. I’ll answer him after I finish this. Sometimes he seems a little needy to me, or he has the longing or desire to show his intelligence, or maybe he wants to feel smart, like memorizing chess opens, or doing AND SAYING weird things to request a reaction, do you understand me? This has been very useless, but kinda helpful, because i still like him, i just want him to be more, himself. WELL I CAN’T DO OR CHANGE THE PERSON HE IS, so psh, what else do I have to say to you. I’m listening to sky ost 2. And I couldn’t resist, I watched videos of the new season, but only the cosmetics, and I like them!! It has a special vibe, I don't know how to explain it OR I ALMOST forgot to say, but there was a thing outside the library, where we could draw, and I drew Bart Simpson xD, because why not? Tomorrow, I will survive, and I will do my best in everything I can!

It seems duolingo has a new way of making levels, and I think I'm almost done with duolingo in spanish?? Nevermind, I have to sleep so I can wake up early tomorrow, sky is releasing a new OST!! I'm SO excited, but I think I have to wait until tomorrow. I had my call with dr qian and I find it very interesting, but it's a bit similar to the project we were doing. I didn't work on sunny side shop, I'll do it tomorrow if I have time. There's not much to talk about today. See you. O and ben want to make a game

    Entry: Today, a lot of awesome things happened today, i saw dr qian, idk why but i wanted to mention him xD. we have our call tomorrow, hope he doesn’t cancel. i put together a detroit mercy! esports server and i told them about a beatsaber contest!! i hope we do it, i almost passed the hard section of spin eternslly!! i’m so excited. and i took down ekko in karuta😂, just when ethan took down saitama in sofi, i love the bot, and i like that he added it to the server. i want to sleep, i’m sleepy, but not super sleepy, i still want to lucid dream, but i haven’t been able to do it- YET. or, i used my lifting emails, and i love them!!! they make deadlifting easy and pain free, i’m a little hungry, and i was sweating a lot when i worked out, but it doesn’t bother me that much, i think i looked really cool and strong. i helped ethan with the seasonal bot. It's not hot, but it's not too cold, I love it. Tomorrow is not a very busy day, I think I'll have to help my dad and mom with their homework, but I'm not going to feel bad! We had the cru meeting, and I want to talk to andy alone, I have a lot of questions, also now I feel more relaxed with my brother talking to my friends, I don't care much, tomorrow morning, I will write the notes for the biology class, O I almost forgot to say, but I started working on sunnysideshop's site. Its code is a little bit advanced, but I can understand it. And I want to use its features in my projects because they are quite useful. I was feeling a little bit overwhelmed because I didn't write the code, so I don't dislike it, I can't describe it. But I know that in the future, and even now, but I understand and write code that I understand, and if I want to do something, I can always do it and I can invent new ways to do things. And I learned that we can use :is as an HTML element, for example, if I have a component - <Button>, I can add <Button type="a" or type="routerlink">, and in the component, we can use <Component :is="" to create those elements, and add other attributes using props, it's something new that I've never thought about, but it's something interesting that from now on, I'll try to use to make my components more useful. We're also using twilwind.css. today I think my Spanish is great, but other days, it fails me a little, I can't wait for tomorrow. See you!

    Entry: I taught ethan how to use promises in javascript, and now his bot works! It's also cold and I love it so much, I didn't have much homework, and I downloaded new sabers on beat saber! I wanted to say he looked muscular, but I didn't have the courage :(, I'm laying in bed, I hope I have a good sleep. I also bench-pressed 190lbs!! I think I could have lifted more! But a lot of people were there! And they used the machines I wanted to use :(. I played sky!! With betty and aj. And I love apple juice with crackers!!! It's wonderful

    Entry: Today I spent most of my day on discord! I found a place to learn more about spanish grammar, and AND I FINALLY PASSED RUSH AND AYYYY I WAS FEELING SO SO EXCITED, I ALSO PASSED/FINISHED MEGALOVANIA with one hand!!! I'm feeling excited too, I even got a better score than naysy!! And I sent it to Ethan on the server :D. I'm trying to analyze my sentences more to learn more about how words and grammar work. What I need to learn the most is how and when I should use articles like un, el, etc. On the server, I have a new command that makes dr meena - the bot's name - call people xD, I also got my lifting straps (correas means strap). I haven't opened it yet, I will tomorrow, but I can't wait to use it! I did some homework so that I won't need to do it tomorrow or during the week, I should probably go to sleep. I had a good time today, I played best saber, I learned more about Spanish and adjectives! They are words that describe nouns, and there are different types of adjectives, like possessive adjectives, like my friend, our houses, possessive adjectives have to match (coincide!) with nouns, and it is an adjective because it describes a noun by showing us who owns it. Now I want, well, I should sleep, I want to improve my Spanish more and more. My Italian too!

And it made me a little angry xD, but I got a lot of cool cards, I'll start with the beginning as normal, I didn't want to go to the meetup, but I did, and I enjoyed it, I saw a lot of people from different backgrounds, some people were deaf, and used ASL, there was also someone, or some people who spoke spanish, and I learned a lot, I had a good time. Oh I need to sleep!! I've been spending a lot of time chatting in the discord chat. Watched some episodes of the simpsons, and apart from the scp meetup. I didn't do much. I fixed the things I want to do tomorrow, I have to read something and watch some videos for religion class. I played sky a little with loule and sean. I need to practice my Spanish more, it hasn't been in the best shape lately. I don't have much to say, I thought I would have more to say, but it seems not, I need new ways or places to practice Spanish, and get feedback. Maybe I should use hellotalk again!!!! It's not a bad idea :)

    Entry: Many wonderful things happened today, and I made some good choices. I'll start with the beginning of my day, of course I woke up, thank God, and went to school, I realized, well, I had realized before, but today in general, is a very busy day for me, so, I decided to exercise in the morning, while I listened to the BIO lab lesson, and I have a lot to say about bio lab, spoiler alert, I love it. So I exercised (I don't think this is right), (I forgot to say that the queen of britain died yesterday), I will continue my day. So I exercised and went to the library, I didn't do much there. I went to religion class, in the test, one supposedly confused me and I got it wrong, but now it doesn't bother me, I had dinner, and went to biology class, where we had another test, and they hadn't taught us some of the questions. That doesn't bother me either. Then for the highlight of my day, bio lab, I worked with my group, and outside of class, we were collecting leaves from trees for an experiment, but dr Carmina told us something about a fruit on the tree, very small and green, and I decided to try it with ethan leone and hadi, it tasted sweet, but it also made my mouth dry!!!!!! Soooo much!!! I didn’t try it again xD. Then we did our experiment with microscopes and the leaves of the trees, and we could see the stomata on the leaves!! How exciting!!! Afterwards, I went back home and decided to do some calculus homework, I HATED IT, it took me 2 hours and 47 minutes to finish it!! At least I finished it, and I don’t have to suffer anymore tomorrow xD. Speaking of tomorrow, I’m annoying uhj, I have the SCP meeting! At eleven, I don’t want to go ughhh, I don’t want to but I’m not going to stress about it, I can’t change it, and I’m going to do it, and I’m going to finish it, and I’m going to move on with my life. I haven't been able to read anything because Ethan wanted to make a discord bot, and I made the dr mina bot xD, but I wanted to do it before eleven, and I did!! The bot documentation is pretty good. Now I want to bathe and sleep!!! I'll talk to you more tomorrow

    Entry: I'm listening to Bob's Burgers music. Today, I did some interesting things! I rented for maybe 10 minutes a bike from the fitness center, and it was so much fun, I love the sense of wind in my face, I think I'll do it tomorrow :D. I still want to buy a skateboard. I have a test in my religion and biology class tomorrow! I hope I have time to exercise tomorrow. I went to school at 9:30. The data structures class confuses me a lot, so I need to practice more with the concepts. I followed the lucid dreaming book, and I want to reach another level of lucid dreaming, now on my wallpaper, I have a picture of a spirit in the sky that says - are you dreaming? I hope it helps me in having more lucid dreams. Today, I almost finished the song Rush e on beat saber!! But I finished 1.78 cents? Or something like that, tomorrow I will read more before my biology and religion test. I took a picture of my body and I think I've worked on it/grown, but I still don't feel happy or satisfied with it!! Especially with my biceps!! Mass Massss. I wanted to say something but I forgot. I heard some people speaking in Spanish, but I couldn't understand what they said because they spoke so fast - I don't know why but this one confuses me a lot, fast, fast, rapid? The last words don't mean fast, or at least I don't think so, it's not like Italian, where you have to match. Changing the subject, having lucid dreams is something I really really want to have and be able to do!! Other than what I've told you, I don't think anything very very interesting happened, I won a giveaway, and I downloaded a lot of really good cards, now I'm going to read the bible, do duolingo, and try to have a lucid dream. The last thing I want to say, I'm liking 3d modeling. It's interesting to do when I'm bored.

    Entry: My day at the gym was great, my brother was there but I didn't care much. I was able to lift more weights than before on the bench press!! 185 for 6 reps, I feel very very happy and proud of myself, actually, it wasn’t that hard, and I think I’ll be able to get to 225 before the end of the year (no del used here, I don’t know why?) I had a weird dream, I finished the book – first day of spring- and I really like it!! I love the ending, and the characters, I also had the call from scp, it wasn’t that long, we talked for maybe ten minutes, I told my mom about the meeting too!!!! Congratulations :D. I’m still learning Italian, if I watch it, I think I’ll be able to understand it, at least the bare minimum, but I’m very very far from fluent. I like my calculus class, we didn’t do much today and I understand the work, I need to practice with trig identities. I think I’ll use the textbook to practice tomorrow at the library. We have more math in data structures than I thought – it’s just that I thought, because we’re using que without a question, so what, but we can’t say more than I thought, so we used more than I thought!! It makes sense, more sense, it will translate to something like - more than what i thought - instead of - more than i thought. I told my friends about my birthday :). Summer will end in two weeks qoop woop!! I can't wait. After I finish the lucid dreaming book, I'll start with the prisoner of heaven - in spanish of course. I haven't practiced my spanish much, and my accent is pure garbage. We did a kahoot in Java class, and I won first place, but I don't know, I felt a little stressed, well, quite stressed, very stressed :(, because I didn't want to make mistakes, why? Because!! Ahh xd Oh my ear hurts :(, I hope it heals soon, tomorrow, I have my call with dr qian, I'm dying to see the new project!! I don't know if he's still doing the research

    Entry: I had a good time today! Happy birthday :D. To start my day, I stayed in bed xD, but when I woke up for real, I wrote some code! And now I feel like my site looks better than before. I used spline 3d and tried to use blender, but I realized that I'm not interested in it, at least now, I don't want to learn it. But I like spline, and it's easy and something that will help my websites. The only thing is that it's not working well on my site, and I want to use it!! I joined their discord server, and I'm going to ask them there how it will work. BUT. I haven't told you the most important and fun part of my day. We went to the buffet, and I forgot my phone!! But I brought my kindle, and I read friday day of spring there. I also tried oysters for the first time! I don't like them that much, but I tried :D. The food was delicious. I also watched a lot of simpsons episodes, I'm watching it now xD. I have to go to school tomorrow :(, and that means I have a class with my brother, oh I need to calm my heart down.

I finished red matter 2!! And it was a pretty weird but wonderful game, I don't understand the ending!! It's very confusing, and a little sad, but I love it. I played a lot of chess, and I ate a lot too. I didn't do work like I wanted to today, and I have a call tomorrow!! I still have to tell my mom that I have to go to the meeting next weekend!! I played sky with loule and sean

    Entry: I feel so so so much better, BETTER, and I love biology lab. Today, we had to sit on the grass and do observations and come up with questions about the environment. Ethan and caleb were there too!! We have groups, and there’s this guy in my group, man, he’s so handsome, he has such a nice face, and wonderful eyes xd, sometimes I feel dumb and write stuff like this xD, but it’s okay, don’t judge me!! He’s handsome, now I want to cut my hair even more!! Because usually it makes my face look more rotund, and it’s so messy :*). When I was walking towards andre in tdr, I didn’t see my brother! And I was like sup, and he looked at me 😂, I felt pretty weird but it was funny xD. Justus was also there and we talked to him, I love my biology lab actually, I like my group!! We also had to share our idea with the class, and in the end, the class shared the idea they really liked, and i think people said they liked our idea! But i also think it’s because we presented last(?), but give me this :*), I also stayed with ethan and caleb to talk to dr Carmona, and he’s a wonderful man, and i can look into his eyes without feeling weird, i don’t feel that way with dr hill xd, or at least sometimes. One bad news, SEED meetings fall at the same time, so i hope i can attend both at the same time. I played a little beat saber and watched some lilly singh videos and an episode of sk8. My mom did smoothies too. Another bad news, i couldn’t exercise! Because my classes are too packed (for lack of a better word). We don't have school on Monday, my birthday :), I need to stop thinking about him lol, oh I really want to get my hair cut, I'll tell my dad, I don't want him to do it, I'd rather go to a barbershop!! But other than that, I feel great Look look look, I opened Snapchat, and it seems that Leone has created a chat for our group!!

It’s about my brother! Oh I don’t feel like writing about him, but it is important. I think I have some ideas about why I feel this way when it happens, and I’m going to write them. First, as you know, we have two classes together, the DS and JAVA class, at the beginning, I was a little afraid that my friends were going to like them more than me, I know that’s not going to happen, and actually, it may be that I’m paying too much attention to my thoughts! Because actually, thoughts are just thoughts, and no one knows what another person is thinking, and also a thought doesn't define who I am, but if it was a thought, it didn't happen - in fact now I feel like watching sk8 again!! And I think I'm going to do it, but yeah. Also sometimes I think I need to outdo him, like it's a competition, and it's something I don't feel with my other brother. For example, he brought his guitar to school, and played it with andreh, andre and other students from seed and oriekaose, now, I don't feel anything, or at least, I don't feel much, and even when he brought it to school, I didn't pay much attention to it, but it's something that bothers me a little, and it's something I've fought with for a long time. And I don't want to say it's normal, but I know I'm getting better, and now, I can control myself. Or at least, I can think about other things and console myself, for example, I still remember when we had GTA vice city, and he passed a mission that he couldn't, and he didn't want me to continue. So I deleted a random file on his computer!! Now I won’t do something like that, not even think about it, and I know I’m improving tremendously when it comes to something that doesn’t affect me, like him learning the guitar or even his introduce me profile for data structures class. I’m not going to write everything I have because I don’t think it’s necessary, actually, I think it’s pointless because it will continue the cycle of comparing myself to him, and I don’t want to, and now I feel better!! I also think I’ve felt about him because I usually try to ignore his existence, I think I’ve written about it before, and now I’m going to stop doing that, and treat him like a normal human, let’s see how it works out!!! But for now, I’ll just stay here with my growths and journeys that I hope no one reads xD. Karuta has changed his way of putting down cards!, now we need slash commands!! I had my leg day, and I like it, I like it, no I LOVE it, I like it! And I think that’s enough, last night, I had a really painful cramp!!! But I held on!! Tomorrow, I think I'll read some of the lucid dreaming book!! I'm still feeling excited, and I'm working on my dream recall ability, it's getting better, but sometimes I still can't remember my dreams, and other times like today, I don't write down everything that happened. I talked to Andy, in calculus, we have a lot of subjects, OH WHY DO OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES ANNOY ME SO MUCH. well, not a lot, but they bother me, for example, I think it's obvious that Andy doesn't know much about what's going on in calculus, but he keeps saying that he's going to do the homework on deadline, and why does that bother me? I don't know!! But yeah OH WHY AM I COMPLAINING SO MUCH, MY BIRTHDAY IS IN FOUR DAYS. I'll be 17 soon!!! What an exciting age, it's not too old, but it also makes me feel a little mature, I want to cut my hair!! I'll tell my parents. Now I feel so happy and less worried, I like my classes, I could write here in Spanish!!!! I have to continue my duolingo streak!! I brought my new mha clothes too!! I started this day feeling meh, but now I feel good, I can't wait for tomorrow, I have my first biology lab!

    Entry: Hoy tengo que decir algo.importante, pues, necesito procesar información, y lo haré en Inglés porque no quiero pensar demasiado en español  Se trata de mi cuerpo. So essentially i wore the long sleeve, the one that makes me look big LOL. And the first thing that has almost always been bugging me, whenever I wear something that off my.muscles, i feel very uncomfortable, especially among family members!!.ESPECIALLY near my mum, I dont know why, but I feel like if I were weaker, or skinnier, I might probably feel even worse! Also I get uncomfortable when people start talking about steroids! IDK WHY, maybe I do, I just need to fish it out of myself.   Anyways, so I ate at tdr, and as usual, my beli got bigger, and it made me feel awkward cause itd kinda liok like I was pregnant if my belly was sticking out! So I was sucking it in as I walked, which felt bad!!!! Ughhh. Then as I  was working out, I talked to the dude from leadership class who was surprise that I was 16, we didnt talk much tho, but when I was working out, I saw this tall jawlineddude xD walkingntowards me, and I suddenly felt so small UGH, it makes me feel like my bones are puny and I'm a shrivelled little bean. So I guess at the end of the day, having muscles is not really a shield in terms of how I see myself, I have no idea how others see me, Mohammed and.m michael and even linu then thought I looked bigger! And even oriekaose, but when they say it, i usually try to shrink down, like, I feel like I want to shave my muscles off, its beginning to feel like something I get embarrassed or flustered about, notnsomething of pride. Like I love love love lifting and seeing the muscles grow and feeling them sore and getting stronger over time!!!! I have goal physiques, but the same way i usually thought of "gym" as a forbidden or off limits words, now I'm morencomfortsble with it, and I never really used to feel comfortable in my skin, even as a lil bebe,   Would I. Keep working out, heck heck yes. I think it boils down to being able to feel more. comfortable in my skin. Being able to stop imagining that everyones just staring at my muscles, or they have some weird interest in them! It's a passing observation, like if I say ben looked jacked in a pic, that's the end of the story!  Another thing I want to do, discover connection is kinda motivating me to talk and introduce myself to a stranger. MAYBE START WITH THE DUDE FROM LEADERSHIP And the dude who I want to be my friend, I wouldnt call myself antisocial by any means, you know and i know that i have friends i really enjoy talking to, but then again, therenare so many experiences i could be missing out on cause I'm not friends or I'm too shy to talk to someone. It's something I'll ruminate over. Maybe not too much, and I'll just jump in and do it. What's the worst that could happen am I right.  In other news, i went shopping with my mum and bought a deku tshirt! Might wear it tomorrow honestly, it looks quite cool, it's a bit tight tho, maybe itll help as a stepping block in helping my body image, or not really my body image since I love how I look, but my body comfortability, how I feel about others looking at my body! It was quite fun. But I really do want to take talking to other people seriously. The power of just being like, hey I've seen you around. What's your name, cool nice to meet you. Then we wave when we see each other. Talk from there. And so on!! Might also start with the dude from bio I see in the gym   Also almost forgot a calculus assignment because the lights went out but was able to do it with 3 mins to spare!!!  o oo oOOoOOO ANOTHER MAYBE EXCITING NEWS, dr qian didnt show up to the meeting cause her other meeting went too long. BUT, SHE MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER PROJECT and I'm excitedddd eeeee, she also updated her websites with our pictures awww. OH and Keegan michael key graduated from UDM, LIKE WHAT  There was also an ice cream social and I grabbed a pomegranate ice cream with Andreh which was amazing, today, was a busy day that didnt feel busy, tomorrow I have java and DS!! WITH YOU KNOW WHO LOL, it's better than I thought. Also turns out oriekaose knows mh brother and has known him for about a semester XD. I'm going to sleep nowntho, sleeping a bit early to wake up feeling more refreshed, I'm going to dream and I've been writing in my.nournal, yesterday I kept waking up after dream sequences and it was coool but I forgot some of my dreams :(. I love college honestly

    Entry: There is NO light :(, nor was it raining but now we have no power, and my phone battery is low, I enjoyed my classes today, although my brother is in my classes, dr mina and ethan made a joke saying that I win the highest point in kahoots xD.. Ob oh, I couldn't finish my routine because I had to go with my brother uhj, but mohammed and michael complemented me!! They said I looked big, my spanish is probably horrible but don't pay attention to them :(, I haven't used that phrase in a long time, now I'm tired and I want to sleep, it's good that it's a little cold, I'll read a little,

    Entry: Ayyyyyyy I have so much to say, and I'm writing earlier than usual because I want to sleep earlier, I'm going to start with the beginning of my day. I felt really tired, and a little bit fat xd, then I went to school, and you know where I went. THE BASEMENT OF THE LIBRARY, and it looks the same! I love the smell, I love the silence, I love my seat, I love everything!!! I want to live there forever :*). I also ate TDR food, and I didn't like meat that much, but I still ate it. In my religion class, there were no seats, and I had to bring a seat from Dr. BARRY's class, and when I saw him, instead of saying - "nice to see you again", I said - "nice to meet you" HOW HORRIBLE LOL, I also saw Ben, and I wanted to talk to him, but I didn't see him when class ended!!! It was like he disappeared. AND AND AND AND I'M SO EXCITED, I WENT TO THE GYMNAOOOOOOOO! And I LIFTED WEIGHTS, AND I LOVE IT, AND I'VE MISSED IT, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK TO MY BACK STRENGTH LEVEL. I really like my routine, I'm doing the 5 day routine, but I'm talking to andre and ethan now, I have to gooooooo, I'll tell you more tomorrow,

    Entry: I’m excited, today is the last day of break, and I’m really excited, really excited, I’ll finally be able to go to the gym!! But I’m also a little sad or rather, I don’t want to be stressed when school starts!! But I know that I’m the one who decides how I react, and I decide to stay calm! I’m not going to write much, I’ll have a lot to say tomorrow xD. Hmm, I talked to loule and, And I found out a new piece of information, he’s 37 years old! And he has a Masters degree in ecology management!! And the funny thing is that I wouldn’t have found out if I didn’t decide to open up a little bit and talk about my past with ecology XD. Now I feel like talking to him more. My brother was asking me riddles, now I’m in the bathroom, I ate a lot, but I decided to, And I tried to watch Star Wars but I didn’t finish it, buuuut I watched a lot of Simpsons episodes and I love it!

    Entry: Ok ok today was pretty productive. But I also didn't eat as well as I wanted. Tomorrow is the last day until school starts!!! So sad :(, but, I did the calculus 2 homework, and I made sure that I understand the things that we're going to review in class for next week. I think that each day, like with calculus, I'll study what we covered the day before, and I'll watch YouTube videos if I feel like the excitement is making me confused. I watched a video of someone who traveled to mexico to learn spanish, and his video is wonderful, and I heard mishail? from language transfer for a second! The calculus 2 homework confuses me a little, but now I think I understand it enough. I'll watch more videos tomorrow, right now I'm showing Andre the spin etwrnally videos on beat saber. I had an interesting but weird dream, I haven't had a lucid dream yet. And I almost forgot to say that my brother is in the java class with me, which, well, I'm not going to think about it, it doesn't bother me and I don't want it to bother me too much. I'm going to sleep right now, but I want to practice my spanish accent, and I finally got it. 1500 in chess. Recently, I haven't played sky much. I think it's because I don't feel like talking to other people anymore, or sometimes I feel like I'm bothering them :*(. I'll try to talk to them more!! I remember talking to mom in the room in the hidden forest, talking to nyny and betty and sean!! I also talked to Caleb and he told me that he has lost his motivation to learn Spanish :(, and I understand, I think if I didn't decide to write here in Spanish, I would have lost the motivation to learn Spanish!! And it almost happened. I also like learning Italian now!! It's a fun language. Now I'm going to sleep, but first I need to read the bible, I'm not going to read much today :(

    Entry: I ate bad, really bad, really bad. I ate three or four pieces of cake, and my mom ordered pizza from dominos today, I didn’t eat much, ok, say. I ate maybe 5 slices of pizza!! But I don’t want to talk about that, at the beginning of the day, I had a really funny dream, it was about legend of korra, and I wrote about it in my dream journal!! I wish I could control my dreams!! Can you imagine if I could control it! And I fought the antagonists with water bending or something! How fun!! I have to master it - master. Then, duolingo did a duocon livestream, and it was quite interesting and thought provoking - thought provoking. I played red matter, and I have to say that the game is sooo ... I love it but it makes me feel dizzy *:(, I did a little bit of yoga, I couldn't resist the temptation, and my younger brother has been nagging me, was he like that when he was younger? Nahh, I don't think so, well it doesn't bother me that much. I wanted to start my learn command line project, BUT, the calculus 2 teacher has unlocked her course on blsckboard, and we already have subjects!! I have to check it tomorrow!! Because school starts in two days aaaa xD. I'll be fine, I know I know, Oh, today I felt very very proud of myself, because I was able to use the dominos app on my phone in Spanish, and I ordered the pizzas like that, I understood almost everything, I could also understand the conversations in Spanish on DUOcon and it also makes me feel happy :D. It's not important but now I have tanjirou in karuta xD. oH OH the book I'm reading is great!! I have to say, I dare say it's my favorite book, but now I love it, it's about about a girl who killed a boy, and we can see inside her brain, too. The book alternates between her life and thoughts as a child, and her adulthood, when she already has a daughter! It’s very interesting, and it’s funny sometimes. Speaking of books! The calculus teacher has read white, the red, and the royal blue!! She put a picture of the book in her example for an assignment. I did it, and I put a picture of sky, I have the feeling that she plays sky!! And when I woke up, people were still talking about the cat ears and the changes xD. What else has happened, I think I’m forgetting something, I felt a little overwhelmed when andre told me that we already have some assignments, now I feel a little more relaxed, but I know that now, NOW, the break is over! Tomorrow, I will do the remaining assignment. At least my parents aren't going to be home, I can do it in the morning, tomorrow I HAVE to do les mills, it's not an option 😭, I tried to make omurice but it came out really really really bad, it didn't taste right Now I think I'll go brush my teeth. I want to improve my Italian, I think Spanish is helping me a lot, and even though I know my Spanish skills are far from perfect, I'm happy with everything I've achieved and learned!

    Entry: A lot of things happened today!! And it's quite late. And tomorrow is Friday, but I have to say it!! First, I went with Uncle Ben to pick up food, and Auntie Pat wasn't there, then, I had to wait maybe an hour - I wanted to walk home!! And I used the phone of a guy there to call my mother, but she didn't answer!! I really wanted to walk home, and I also thought that a bee stung me, but it seems not, or at least I don't feel anything. At least I listened to some language transfer lessons. Then, I played red matter, it's very interesting! And quite complex, I did maybe 20 minutes of les mills, and it was quite intensive. Then I had to help my father with his work. THEN, the beginning. I didn't want to see spoilers for the new season of sky, but it seems that there is a new cosmetic, a cat ears, but TGC put it as an IAP, and everyone is angry! I'm also angry, but not much. Chess.com had an update, and I'm about to reach 1500 elo!

    Entry: Good afternoon, i had some fun, talked to andre, ethan and michael, and bought a new game - red matter 2. It made me motion sick, but i like it a lot!! Especially when i finally understand what's going on! The only thing that bothers me now is that i have to go with aunt pat tomorrow to pick up groceries, it doesn't bother me that much, and i can listen to language transfer lessons, i downloaded the new music theory lessons, but still, it's something i'll have to do xd, and these days, i don't have much to do xD, i didn't do any real exercise, i should have done yoga, but my wrist still bothers me, ugh. But i did play a little bit of les mills. Today, i was a little productive, i sent the answers to the questions for SF - skillman... to richard, and i signed up for another vue forge thingy, and it's an ecommerce site, and it seems like there's going to be some useful tools, like dartree? Something like that? It's like firebase, but I find it easier to use. We're also going to use stripe!! I want to do this, I told daniel I was going to create an ecommerce site, and I'm going to do it aaa. A new guy joined the server and he's very strong. Oh oh and I tried to make spanish omelettes, it didn't turn out well, but it tasted good.

    Entry: Oh my stomach hurts, Richard sent me an email inviting me to join a meeting with some very popular/important guy? But I CAN'T GO/can't go, because school starts next week, and the meeting is on Monday of next week, ugh. I already said I can't go, but I need to give my brother and I answers - for the skillman foundation thing. I also emailed trajan woop woop, my birthday is in twelve days?, I don't know but pretty soon, I'll be seventeen, I like that age, it makes me feel more mature, but not much. I finished the book - the signs from a self made merchant to his son. Tomorrow I'll start another book. There were some mean guys on the server, but I muted them. I feel a little fat, but I know I'm not. I tried making cookies but I put too much sugar :(. I played beatsaber!! And showed my recordings to hansel and andre. I didn't do any real exercise today, my wrist still hurts, and I don't want to make it worse Andy - from cru- just texted me! Oops I feel so awkward xD

    Entry: Today I feel great, I've been working on the design of my new project and I think it's the best design I've done so far, and I'm really really excited!!! It's going to be a really fun project. Oh I didn't watch go lessons, but that's okay. School starts in a week guys!! Just a week. Also today, I worked on the cru bot. I listened to music, played chess, and won a lot of matches. I also played beat saber and showed it to my dad XD. I tried to play totf but my wrist hurt a lot! And I want it to heal before school starts! So I think I'll just play beat saber and a little bit of les mills, just a little bit. Also the sunny days in sky have started! I didn't play with anyone, but that doesn't bother me much, I talked a little bit with Mj. Now I think I'll take a shower, it smells horrible in here xd, but I spray-spray-perfume and now, it smells a little bit overwhelming, but I don't care that much. I did a lot of italian lessons. And it made me feel really good and kinda smart hehe. Oh I should email Trajan!! We’ve been talking for a long time, and even though I don’t have much to say, it’s a relationship I want to continue, I’ll do that tomorrow. I hope he remembers. And I found the perfect way to make bananas, I have to mash it a little bit, and I fry it with air with a temperature of 390 for maybe nineteen or twenty minutes, that will make it bigger I JUST HEARD MY BROTHER, AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE’S STILL, still? I didn’t know they were talking, but HE’S TALKING TO ADENIYI, HOW FUNNY?? HOW INTERESTING, I don’t know how to feel xD

    Entry: At first, I felt bad, but I ended my day working on a new prototype/design for my next project - the site to help people understand how to use the terminal! I'm feeling really excited because I have a lot of ideas and I think it's going to be a very complex project, but also very interesting, I want to have different levels and very creative functions, I think I can do it. I know I can do it. I'm not going to do it with the vue server because we're working on sunny side shop, and actually, I'm happy, because it means I can do what I want, but it will also be a big help to have other people, but I don't mind that much. Oops I forgot, I wanted to work on the cru bot today, I messaged mysticelephant because I need the API link. It seems we don't want to ask for more versions anymore and it makes me happy. OH today I watched some videos of lilly singh and actually, I've missed her :*), and also miss yates. I WANT TO SEE THEM - miss yates and Johnson, I haven't seen them for a long time!!!! I need to find a way to talk to them. I'll try to open my central email now!! I can't remember my email name :(. But it's okay! I'll try some way to talk to them. I think today was the first day I earned/reached more than 100 PAI points on my fitness band!! And I think it's because of les mills, I'm going to do it tomorrow. OH NO. It's been a week since I played totf, I need to continue but my wrist hurts :(. That's not going to stop me. I'm brushing my teeth now, I don't feel like taking a shower. Oops I ate a lot today and I don't feel very tired. I can't wait to continue designing my new project. And school is going to start in a week! I'll finally be able to lift weights againzz m

    Entry: Mmmmeeehhhhh i just spent maybe two hours or an hour and a half scrolling through reddit - scroll means scroll, and oca means goose, we learn something new every day - downloaded a puzzle game. But today i didn't do much/anything. I didn't work on the questions i need to give to Richard BUT i told my mom about the show, and told her i have an scp meeting on september 10th and 17th. But other than that, I didn't do anything, I made pancakes, and sweet potatoes, but they didn't taste sweet :(. I watched YouTube videos about American got talents and it was pretty funny. I didn't read anything from the book, I didn't write code, well, I didn't write much code, I fixed two? bugs, but that was all. BUT I played Les Mills and beat saber, I found some fun and interesting maps. But there is something that is bothering me a lot, and it's something that could change my life! But I don't think I have the courage to write it here ;(, maybe in the future, but I also think I know the cause of the problem! I don't want to focus on that, I played chess and won my quintet game. And I finally got the mask of the elders on sly

    My mood Unsure
    
    Entry: Ughhh I think I'll write in english since this isnt my usual journal, but woke up today - and added to my dream journal, not which much specificity tho. I'll add to it now, but richard sent me a message asking me and my brother to apply for a skillman foundation youth council thing- he just messaged me that hes outside for the giftcards lol. But he said we should apply for a skillman thingy. And its going to be for two years, and it says meetings will be up to 12 times a year, which honestly doesnt feel that much now that I say it outloud, but it's just going to be another thing i have to think abojt!!! And it seems just like another SCP type of program, which I guess isnt bad, but it also doesnt do much and I feel like it's not going to be worth my time.  But then again, I decided that I should take up opportunities cause I dont know where theyd lead me and the people.itd introduce me.too, life is spontaneous and if I really dont want to do it, I know I can turn down the offer, but this idny really something that requires a big sacrifice, or at least I hope that it's not. What's the worst thing that can happen, itd definitely be a new experience that could take me.places, ugh why not!! Bjt now I'm trying to see the part of my.life that involves balancing being unproductive/lazy but not really.lazy, with the part that's always like ok, let me do this new thing and is constantly stressing, well not really stressing over it. Wed see what happens tho  Writing does make it feel better, it's not a big commitment and I do get the chance to improve my connections, which could help a lot, just like Vanita helped too! Also I need to tell my mum about the SCP meeting on sep 10!

    Entry: I dare say I feel great today👀👀. I did a yoga session that took forty minutes!! And I felt really really good. I also tried a new recipe called gnocchi. It didn't turn out great, but I still feel proud because I tried something new. I also started another book, messages from a self made salesman to his son or something like that, and it's not a fictional story, but it has practical advice and a really good message. I downloaded the new version of beat saber, and now I have Chrome and noodle!! And it's really fun. Tomorrow I'm going to play les mills for extra exercise. I also seem to have reached level 60 in PAI - for me my band. I didn't have a lucid dream, but now I'm using my notes app to write down my dreams because I don't like the app I use anymore. I watched a few episodes of one piece, and also the go course. In the book, something I learned is that it doesn't mean anything to know a lot if I can't apply the knowledge, and to know when it's relevant and when it's not. And that was something I needed to hear. I also played sky with nyny and betty. I've missed them a lot actually. Sometimes I think that talking to them drains my energy, but I don't think that's the case, it's true that I usually feel overwhelmed when there are a lot of people I need to talk to, but it's really nice to talk about life with other people, like on the fitness server.

    Entry: Today I went to my brother's graduation, ms vanita was there, and my brother won second place, and he was acting really angry xD. Actually, after that, I didn't do much, I played beat saber and chess, I didn't chat with anyone in particular, I didn't have an interesting dream, a mediocre day. But I don't want to be so negative, I watched an episode of the soap opera, I saw lyrik and she told me that she was going to hook up with me, I don't have my internship anymore, and tomorrow I'll have a lot of free time, which I guess is a bad thing but also a good thing. I'm going to try to read a new book tomorrow called - a something masters letter to something, it seems like it's really short, but yeah. I was having a hard time choosing a book to read when I'm trying to lucid dream, and I decided - it seems like it's deciding, not just deciding - that I was going to read that book. ALSO you know metamask and the password I was looking for, I found it on my old computer! And it seems I have no money there 😅, also quora is stopping their money making program for questions, and I need a SSN to use stripe, and that will mean I will lose my money forever, I don't care much, what I want to do is invest my money in cash app. I'm rereading romans, and I emailed UDM to ask them about my financial aid requirements. I'm excited to start classes again!!! The food and the freedom. I still feel very sad that Aaron left UDM. :(, I'll try not to think about ellib too much

    Entry: I think I had an interesting day, but I ruined it a bit because I played chess, and lost a lot of games :*), but I did some duolingo lessons, and now, the highlight of my day, the graduation of the students, I saw Zuri and gerliz- she is very pretty! And sarai, nikah, jas- also very pretty, nihya, and kylee. I also saw Kevin from the NBC stock webinars. We played one and sarai’s dad is very muscular. I didn’t eat much today, and I didn’t have a lucid dream. Oh now I don’t feel so happy because I lost so many chess games, but I smiled a lot! And Arju told me that actually, his name is Arif and he did the show for his brother, the real Arju. I hope to see him on campus. I read more about lucid dreaming, and now I have my watch, I think I’ll try it again tonight, but before I fall asleep, I’ll tell myself that - when I wake up, I’ll be in a lucid dream, I hope it works, but tomorrow, I have to follow my brother to his graduation. And I still STILL don’t know if I should talk to or contact Giraffe, ugh it’s been maybe a year??? I don’t know what we can talk about, I’ll keep thinking about it, but I think, ugh I don’t know, if I talk to him, it might turn out to be the best decision of the month, but I also don’t want to talk to him, and then stop talking after a month or less!! Aww how stressful. I’m going to take a shower to calm down. My thighs feel a little sore, and my right wrist hurts a little, but it doesn’t bother me much. MY INTERNSHIP IS OVER OH WOW, SO EXCITED, but also sad, because it will mean that I won't have a consistent schedule anymore, but at least it will mean that I will have more time to do what I want!! And I can read more, and exercise more with VR. Actually, I need a rest day, because today, I also did a quick les mills session - I didn't finish it :(, but I felt really sluggish, and tomorrow, I'll rest. Also, I haven't played thrill of the fight for a while. So, more than more, I feel better now, even though I lost a few chess games, at least I know that my skills have increased, and now I can see the players' potential games, but sometimes I make mistakes, and I already know that in reality, I'm not very good at chess. Or I discovered a guy on discord lying, he said that he drew some paintings but they looked very similar to the paintings in midjourni- the AI, and he was right 😂. So, speaking of which, today I tried to learn more about how AIs work, and I found out that first, we have to have a lot, or at least a lot of data, then, we give that data to the computer, and lol, this is really hard to explain in Spanish, but we give the data to the AI, and with code, we can say that we want a type of data. modeling specific, like linear regression, etc. And then, the computer does the calculations. But now in English so I can understand and teach a bit better, the computer sees the images in terms of matrices and their pixel correspondents from 0 to 255, or something like that, then with our data, it notices patterns with those pixels and the variables we give it, and with that, when we feed it another picture. It can find the pattern and feed us back to a prediction

    Entry: I tried looking dreaming again but it didn't work :(. Hmm, I couldn't resist the temptation twice :(, and my mom brought a lot of food :0. My internship ends tomorrow!!!!! Then I'll have some free time, but I need to continue the go course! On the vue server, we're going to start the sunnysideshop project. What's more, I learned the difference between SSR and CSR, with SSR, the site already has JS on the server, so, the server builds the site with js- dynamic data, and because of that, the clients - the browsers - can see what's going to be in the html file, compared to CSR, when the server just returns an html file, and then, the browser downloads the js and css files.. I'll try looking dreaming again tonight, and I hope it works. I watched some episodes of one piece, and I worked a little on cleaning up dr. Qian's code, we're going to have our call, oh oh I need to talk to lyrik!! I think I'll see her tomorrow. I'll keep reading the lucid dreaming book. And I did a les mills routine and now, my thigh hurts - thigh, we played another skribbl game and it was hilarious. And I tried another recipe, and I'll give it a 3.8/5 rating. And, my mom made smoothies!! And they tasted great

    Entry: The internship was very very interesting. We didn’t do much and we played skribbl, I won of course, but we laughed a lot. I have found that I can’t smile for a long time, it exhausts my lips and they start to flutter. I also lost my streak because I forgot to read the bible yesterday. Also with the cru discord bot, mysticelephant wants us to keep trying to use the NIV version. I actually don’t want to use it because it seems like it’s a difficult process and not worth it, but I also want to do something I’ve never done before, so I’m still trying to connect with the company to see how I can use it, but I also told them that I don’t feel comfortable, and I want to know that everything we do is legal, then I will feel more comfortable, but now, well tomorrow, I will send an email to biblica to ask if we can use the version, even though our use case involves citing more than 25 percent of the data. I tried lucid dream again but it didn’t work :(, I have it in my dream journal. Also for the internship, we have a webinar, but it’s not a webinar, it’s optional, and I was the only person on the call, but we’re going to learn, well, I’m going to learn about stocks, and that’s something I’ve wanted to do for quite a while. I’ve learned about dividends – money a company can give you if they want and only when the stock increases in price. And stocks are parts of a company, and you can make money from buying the stocks, or from the dividends. And that’s all I learned xd. I watched a few episodes of one piece and bought a new VR game – les mills, it’s really intense, and I think I’m going to use it for exercise

    Entry: I just learned something, nouns -nones- in Spanish have a gender if we talk about something that is born, like a dog, or a bitch, so that means that for living things, we have to relate them to their gender. But for things like the tie, which never change, they will always have their gender. And last night, my lucid dreaming experiment didn't work, well, I dreamed, but I wasn't lucid, and when I woke up, I moved a lot, but there was a point where I felt like I was going to fall asleep. But today, I didn't do a lot of things, I played beat saber and tried to collaborate with kalle Hallden on her project on Github but I decided it wasn't worth the time, now, I don't know flutter and I won't be able to contribute much. Tonight, I will try to make luce dreaming again, but this time, my reminder is at five at night, and I have to stay calm when I wake up.

I hope he's okay, and I don't know how I can talk to him ;(. And now, I'm excited to start learning how to lucid dream, I'm going to try using the FILD method tonight, I have my reminder for three in the evening. I hope it works, and if it doesn't, I'll try again! And I started a book on lucid dreaming and I find it very interesting

    Entry: I have, so I want to do something. I want to be a person who can decide what I want to learn, and learn how to do it, I have a lot of potential and even more time, I need to do something with it, and I want to learn how to lucid dream and I'm going to do it! Since I've finished the book Angel's game- I still feel very confused, and many people feel that way, I'm going to read the book about lucid dreaming. It's something new, and I've seen that if I want to learn/do something, I can do it, like when I started the book and thought it was going to be very difficult, well I finished it! And I can finish this challenge too, wish me luck but I don't need it eeeee, hello me from the future, have I learned how to do it? If not, :(, but you have managed to do it. :) I'm proud of you

    Entry: I know it's really late, but I just finished playing Angel, and I'm really really really confused, and sad :(. Or also, I found out that Aaron has gone to udmercy and wants to join the army - well, he already has, but I feel pretty sad, I was really looking forward to seeing him and having lunch with him and talking about ice cream :(, I'm going to sleep now. Oh! And I want to learn more about web3 and blockchain, but the more I learn about it, the more confused I get, I understand the idea of ​​web3, we want there to be no middleman, but I don't understand the idea of ​​Nfts - I still think they're stupid ideas, but I want to learn how to use blockchain, or rather, how I can connect to it like with servers. Hmm there's something else, I kinda understand the idea of ​​bitcoin and cryprocurrenvy, but only a little

    Entry: Can I write in english. Yeah I'll write in english since I'm feeling a bit unsure and my thoughts arent as organized, also doing it earlier in. the day buttt, went to school and met with the group, evan. Ben, andre andreh and the new students from seed - theyee pretty cool, seyed I believe followed us with andre who wanted to buy books but she kept stopping him and saying he could save money somewhere else xD.  I feel like I'm stuck in this weird non triangle type of shape, like ben talks good about me a lot, and I dont really feel like I deserve it, would rather get more attention than less. Then I also think that evan is pretty cool, hes good math and games? Like we played tennis and he was better than me, but also played 4 connect and I was close to winning XD. Also his manbun , future me is gonna look at this and cringeee, hi future me xD, but anyways, I do think hes cool, same with andreh. Am I beginning to worry about how others perceive me? Prolly, should I, prolly not, was this entry necessary, doubt it, but its still something I'm gonna do, didnt workout today YET, gonna play totf. But yeah.  This was a useless entry dang 😂, nahh, also I feel like social settings turn off a part of my brain, or turn on another part? Its like I lose the sense of self reflection I usually get when I'm alone, or maybe its just the lack of quiet and I cant hear myself think, it makes me feel different than when I'm on my own. That's for sure. Not a bad way tho, makes me kinda miss school, actually can't wait, I'm gonna be in the Ecology lab!!! I have to spark a relationship with dr carmona. Hopefully Caleb's convincing pulls through

    Entry: Is there a lot to say? Sure there is a lot. Now I can say that I did a lot today, at first, I woke up and was pretty lazy, I watched some videos of the golang course, and I had my internship, it was really interesting, we played skribbl twice, and I won once and zuri beat me once, but during the last question, I had to draw John Xena, and I told sarai that I already knew it, I laughed a lot xD, finally she had the answer, but it was too late 😂😭. Then, the card competition continued, and at the beginning, the organizer put me against Marin- and I almost won!!! ALMOST, with only 1 vote, but I won third place!!!! I didn’t know I was going to win, but the other guy used shinobu instead of tanjiro!! And that’s why I won. On the vue server, we’re going to make an ecommerce site, but first, we’re going to make my idea of ​​a site to learn how to use the terminal. It’s going to be really interesting and I can’t wait. Hmm, what else have I done, I worked on my budgeting site and now, I just need to make the billing page, And I started One Piece, I don’t really think I like it that much but I’m still going to watch it. I also started another anime called Aharen aharen san, but it looks a lot like komi to me. I don’t think I’ll finish it. Hmmm I read Angel’s game, and I think I can finish it during the next week, I’m 80% done with the book. I didn’t exercise! Well I did a little bit of yoga but not much because my head hurt ughj, I also want someone who I can practice Spanish with. In my internship, I made a squarespace site with a toothpaste service called haste for paste😂😂. Tomorrow I have to go to school at ten!! Come on everything will go and And I found this little thing on a discord server, it’s a discord bot like DALL -E and it’s really awesome! Now I’m going to sleep!! I don't have much to do tomorrow BUT I sent a message to lyrik and we're going to meet up tomorrow, all goes well And it feels like two years since I made my intro for eildlife buddies. TWO YEARS

And when i was playing i hit my brother, and i think that was the first time i hit someone in a long time, and i want to do it more >:) nah i'm kidding, or maybe not >:). I cooked today, i read today, i watched videos from spain today, i got some good cards in karuta today, i worked on my site's responsiveness, and dr qian emailed me, we're not meeting until september 1st!!!! i hope he doesn't forget, i also have to go to school on friday for the dr hill thing. i can't think of anything else i did. i talked to ben and leia and andre... , i haven't played sky with the server in a long time. i played skribbl with the internship!! and it was so much fun!!

    Entry: I think I’ve found a different kind of feeling, sometimes when I start something new, even something as small and insignificant as a YouTube channel, I feel weird, for example, right now, I found a new channel called geography now, and there’s a part of me that wants to watch their videos and feels overwhelmed, but there’s another part of me that doesn’t care and just wants to learn about Spain and not about other countries :(. Now, I want to do the last one, I’ve survived without thinking about other countries’ cultures, and when I want to learn about something, it’s better that it doesn’t overwhelm me. But changing the subject, what have I done today? Not much really, I played beatsaber and watched family guy videos, I did yoga!! At first, I didn’t want to do it, but I decided to finish it- it was maybe a 15 minute session, then, I started another 15 minute video too. Or and I made fancy food xD

    Entry: I just joined a new karuta group, it’s a new clan, and they are very interesting and chaotic people. One of them gave me maki oze, shigaraki, and another card that I can’t remember. Hmm, the internship was good and nice, I played skribbl with Sarai!O and won a game against Money maker in totf. I read a bit too, I think I’ll finish the book before school starts. Oh, I have to go to school on Friday, but at least I’m going to meet ben. Andre told me that sara has already left for udm, I don’t know why, but I don’t feel very sad, if I were Ethan or ben, I’ll feel much sadder xd. Hmmn, O someone bought the sakura snack frame and now I have the blessing of generosity :D. And today, I didn’t eat much, I made a mayo and tuna sandwich, and it rained a lot today, and now it’s a bit cold. I should add an activity for boxing. And I got UTA FROM BUBBLE IN KARUTA, and shikimori!! What a great day, we collected a lot of food, and now we have pasta and fancy rice, I’ll try to cook that tomorrow, we don’t have chicken :(, actually, I’ve recently tried to remove chicken from my diet, I eat it on Sundays now, but I haven’t felt like eating it during the week, I’m starting really slow, but yeah. I still want to eat less meat, even though I don’t work in the environmental field, I can at least do some things to contribute. And, oh I remembered, I’m starting to learn golang!! Are you excited?? I’m excited :), now we’re almost done with the basic functions of the bot, and we just need to do a few things, oh I need to send emails :*0. But yeah, I can’t wait to learn golang. Also I still need to find a way to make my budgeting site more responsive. I’ll change my mood, I feel great! AND BECAUSE OF MY PAST POSTS, I FOUND OUT THAT TODAY IS KRISTINA LYNN'S BIRTHDAY, I don't watch her videos like I used to anymore, but I still love it when I do.

    Entry: Today, I didn't do much, I played factorio and it was pretty interesting but also frustrating, but now I have a plan to kill the biters xd, I just need some torettas, drones, and stones, after I get that copper field - copper :0, I'll add it with my copper sources on my main site, also I've come to the conclusion that I just need to focus on automating the sciences, and when I do, find out more about new technologies because I'll have to create the sciences and the precursors. Hmm, my internship will end next week! Time has really gone by really fast. I played super hot, hmm, I watched family guy, actually, like I said before, I didn't do anything today xD, but I did watch some videos in spanish, I don't know if I should lower my standards at the end of the week, sometimes, I do a lot of things, but it seems like I haven't done anything. I know that today, I didn't really do anything xd, which is kinda sad? I don't think that's the right word, but I have limited time - thanks I wanna eay your pancreas, and the reality is that most of my days lately have been very banal and boring! But I also guess I should enjoy days like that, because it means that nothing worries me, and nothing bad has happened, and I have to thank God for that. I watched a video of a snow storm in Madrid - I think Laura from after spanish hours had made a video like that too, and I really feel like I've experienced snow! I can't wait for winter. It's not that hot here, and before I forget, Detroit Mercy has sent the link to thank the scholarship donor, and I did it yesterday. Tomorrow, I hope to start the Go course, at least I want to learn the basics, like with Italian, I watched a video, and I could distinguish a few words with similar principles to Spanish. Now I'll read a bit and go to sleep.

    Entry: I just watched - i want to est your pancreas - and it's pretty sad! And I think it's a sign that I should live my life more happily, but it's also kind of interesting, because there is a life after this life, and sometimes, it seems like I overestimate the importance of this life. But other times, it seems like this life is the only life I'll ever have :*). I guess it's just my point of view at that moment. Today I had lunch, yuck, I tried using ketchup with pasta, it didn't taste good :*), then I tried making pizza, it tasted awful, and then I made mac n cheese, pretty unhealthy, and I didn't play at all, I think I'll play it tomorrow if I can. And again, I think this weekend has gone by too fast!! It's like how I haven't done anything, or how time is passing faster and faster ;-;. It may be because I'm not gaining more experience, I'll see what happens when I start going to udm AND LIFTING WEIGHTS. I'm sweating a lot, I'll take a shower later. I did some work on my budgeting site, and recently, I haven't paid much attention to learning Italian :(, and reading the bible, but I'll keep doing that. I wanted to say something, oh I remembered what I wanted to say. I've been watching videos about Spain and tapas and stuff like that.

    Entry: What an interesting day, I tried to log into my old reddit account - I can't remember my password, but it's okay. Buuuut, I could finally find my username, and I was looking at old posts of myself from the past, and I guess I can say that I've changed, I've changed a lot, well, actually, it's a bit superficial to say that I've changed a lot for two or five posts, but I can say that my attitude on social media has changed. And it seems like it's been three years since I met giraffe and savvy and I don't know if it's nostalgia, it probably is, but I still miss them aaaaa. I'm not going to think about it :(, the past is the past. Hmm, oh something interesting happened, I think by accident, I sent a link of the fitness server to Ben! And he put the server together. It's good that I don't talk much xD. This week has gone by so so fast. Same with last week. Meh can't wait to go back to college and lift weights!! I'm watching videos - oh I should email Trajan, but usually I think I don't know what to talk about :(, but yeah, I'm watching videos from Spain, I hope giraffe is okay. Or and I made a new recipe today, well, two, but the second one was a total failure. I haven't done any real exercise ;-;, I play totf, and I played it today :*), a match of about 20 or 30 minutes. Or now I want to go to Spain xD, why? Don't ask me xD. Hmm what else to say, I talked to my colleagues from journi and we talked about beat saber. I haven't started the go course, I think I'll start it on Monday, and I still need to finish my project!!!! The budget site

It's raining now too, but not much. I played totf today and yesterday, I didn't do a normal exercise :*). I was watching videos about the culture in Spanish-speaking countries, and now, they don't excite me much :(, it's a little disappointing, but it's okay, and I think this sense will go tomorrow, right now, I'm interested in Japanese culture, well, the food, because I made omurice this morning and it was delicious. I played skribbl with Sarah and Nikah and it was very very fun and funny.

Well, I haven’t finished the first episode yet, but that’s okay. Today, I was really really bored, I started reading the book at seven! Or maybe after six, at least I’m practicing my spanish. Dr hill sent me an email and I need to answer it, but first I need to ask mos.pafred if I can go to the meeting. Now I was feeling a little bit fat xd. Well, I don’t know, I was working out when my brother came in, and I finished doing that. I’ll play thrill of the fight tomorrow. CAZZZZZZO I forgot about dr Qian’s meeting ACHHHHHHH, ACH CAZZO ARA, ayyy, but it’s okay, okay, okay 😭. I gave money to language transfer - only 15 bucks, and bought super hot, it’s pretty interesting and a little bit difficult. I should have bought half life alix, or something like that. :(. But I don't care much, as long as I can move, now I'm going to shower. Tomorrow is Wednesday

I went to pick up food with my dad and we picked up a lot of food, today, I ate a lot, but I also worked out, I found a workout video and did that. I also played thrill of the fight. I tried to practice my technique. I played echo vr too, and I also had a call with liryk? Who I’m going to work with, and it was really short, but it’s a Shopify site and she wants to enter an amazon contest about sustainable business owners, I hope I can help her, I haven’t used Shopify, but it shouldn’t be hard. I’ll watch tutorials tomorrow. Hmm I was talking to my brother about space, and he thinks NASA is lying to us xD how funny. I've missed these conversations, and the giraffe and savy conversations, but now I have a new group of friends, with vex, one and hansel. I talk to them a lot, and I mustn't underappreciate them. Oh and I wanted to say that I was working on the cru bot with mateus, and finally the pagination works!! How cool. See you tomorrow, I want to take a shower

    Entry: Sometimes I feel very very small, not physically, but in the grand scheme of things. For example, when I think about something, for example, if someone tells me something that makes me angry, then, I try to relax and think that things like that are useless and I should focus on how God wants me to live. But then, I feel like my longings and emotions are useless, and I am just a small human in a small world with small longings and useless worries, but what can I do small. I can only continue my life and try to take advantage of all the opportunities and possibilities of adventures. Speaking of which, I have my call with lyrix tomorrow, and I think she wants to restart her business because of the person - kristen Davis - who spoke to us on the webinar. Buuuut, I hope everything goes well. What's more, I played best saber and watched a few episodes of tokyo revengers and takt op destiny but I didn't like it. I have nothing more to say, tomorrow the week will start, I can't wait to work out and box. I've also realized that I prefer the weekdays, at least sometimes, because I can be productive, but I can also relax, during the weekend, I usually don't do anything productive ;-;, or maybe I have too high standards for myself Or and there's a new event in karuta

Uhj I feel like this during the weekends, and I guess it’s because I’m right, actually, ever since we stopped doing the coding club, I’ve felt like this, nahh, I don’t think so. But still, nothing spectacular has happened today, there was a homeless man on the stairs but it seems he left, and I played echo vr and beat saber. I worked a bit on the responsiveness of my website, or and I started spy x family and at the beginning, I thought it was overrated, but it’s okay, I like the sauce on chinese food, but it seems my stomach doesn’t. I haven’t read the bible today and it’s too late because I was reading one punch man, it’s very interesting! Or And, I played thrill of the fight :), but I want to know when I will see a difference in my cardiovascular state

    Entry: I think I’ve realized the advantage of writing here, and I want to keep doing it!! I was looking at pictures on my mom’s Facebook when I was young, and I saw the house in magodo, I didn’t remember some things, but the things I remembered made me feel nostalgic? I don’t think that’s the ideal word, but yes, I want to keep growing and gaining memories!! For example, today, I had a call with mystic elephant and we worked on the cru bot for almost four hours!! And we made progress, I used firebase and it was very very easy. Richard also paid me, and he told one of his employers about me, and it seems that she wants to make a website, and I’m going to make it for her. Now, I don’t know if she’s using Shopify, but I can learn. And it’s something I’ve wanted to learn for quite some time. At first, I felt awkward but that feeling went away very quickly, and now I’m excited, because she may be my first client. We also bought food from China and I don't know why but I'm not going to complain, I read opm manga and didn't work much on anything today, I played echo vr and a bit of beat saber. And I have to say something, I didn't work out today :(, oh I KNOW, and I'm going to do it tomorrow, I'll do boxing - totf, but yeah, I'll try not to worry too much about it. It seems like jasmine hasn't talked about the podcast anymore, and there's a part of me that wants it to stay that way, right now, I don't feel like taking a shower. I also want to donate to language transfer

ALSO, they did a livestream today and I tried to find them but I couldn’t, but I think other people were trying to do the same, one of the devs played never gonna give you up, and I found someone playing it in the same place!! How funny. And I played echo vr with some kids and they were winning but I kept hitting them, and then we won the match- he was the mvp. Also dr qian cancelled our meetup, and I like it like that but only a little. Hmmm so I worked on the cru bot and made a lot of progress, I also fixed some bugs in my budgeting site’s style, the class was really interesting, I ate donuts and realized that now, food doesn’t affect me as much as it used to!! I can eat without feeling guilty!! I’M STILL NOT OVER THE FACT THAT SKY IS COLLABORATING WITH AURORA AAAAAAA. BUT I did a quick yoga routine, and now my back hurts xd. A lot of good things happened today, buuuut there’s just one thing that leaves a bad taste, Jas wants to do a podcast, and she’s talking to richard tomorrow, so we’re gonna get on a call tomorrow and talk about it, and I’m not really looking forward to it, but I’m gonna do it with jas and sarai and nikah and I like them. What worries me is that it probably won’t work out – people won’t listen to us, and I don’t know what we’re gonna talk about, but that’s okay!! I mustn't have the changes. I need to accept them and learn to live with them!! I'm reading the one punch man manga and the Angel game, which is quite interesting, sometimes I remember The Shadow of the Wind a lot, but other times I don't. Oh so exciting, I won't let the podcast ruin my mood. I'm going to take a shower, and I don't have work tomorrow!! Oh oh oh this week has gone so so fast!! I'll do my boxing routine tomorrow, I can't wait, it's quite interesting and fun. I also want to learn more about web3, but right now I'm not going to think about them and I'm just going to enjoy the moment.

    Entry: I feel so proud of myself. I found and added the code to make the prompts not repeat more than four times. The class was so so fun today! We played a puzzle kahoot, and I won! Zuri was about to win, but she got a question wrong xD. Hmm what else, I played echo vr, I'm watching YouTube videos, hmm. I read today, and I actually really like the book, something by Angel, I still don't know the name of the book!!! Oh gosh. Angel's game!! That's the name!! Other than that, today came out really fast, this week it's coming out really really fast. I have my call with dr Qian tomorrow!! Actually, I just want to send an email, but I also want to talk to her because I haven't seen her in a long time, and I like her. I'm going to take a shower now. See you later Lucas OO o I played totf as my exercise, and I think I'm getting better. But I still need to practice more, and I don't want to develop bad habits.

    Entry: Actually, I did a lot today, I made mashed potatoes - but they tasted salty. The internship went really well, there was a webinar and after, we played kahoot- with the students about tiktok and interesting facts and emojis xD, it was really funny. I accidentally deleted the person in the first place xD. Then, I added the code to add the basic questions before the IT. Then I worked on the cru bot, and I could make the bot receive data from the user, and call an API to display information, I felt really proud of myself. I played echo vr and had two interesting matches, in one of the matches, we had to keep playing five times because nobody won. In another match, they were winning with 0-6, but we came back and won with 12-6, everyone on the other team left the match.

    My mood Great
    
    Entry: Today, it was pretty productive! I started the day with a bad dream, and I didn’t feel like getting on the internship call, but I ignored the feeling and had a great time. I picked up food with my dad, there wasn’t much food, but we got magdalenas – muffins, what an interesting word, it sounds like a name to me, or the name of a place. I also learned that we say a la una or a las dos when we talk about time because a la una actually means at one hour, or at seven hours, but we just say a la/las…, and I know this because I listened to some language transfer lessons. aYYYY AY AY I JUST LEARNED SOMETHING. Unas/unos is not a word!! It’s some, some…, we only use unas/unos when we talk about something like that – unos llegó tarde, as a plural of uno??? How cool, from now on, I will use some... instead of a.. I also updated my beat saber, it's now at version 1.21. 1, and it's really cool because now, there are more songs, but I still can't use chrome or noodle. For a workout, I played thrill of the fight, and it was pretty intense, I did a warm up, and then, I fought two matches and a match with the sparring partner. I played more beat saber, wrote some code for dr qian's site - and I emailed her, I have my call with her this week and I won't forget it!! I also fixed some bugs in the code - with the data, and now everything seems to work!! I'm really glad. I also learned about environment variables in nuxt.js, and at first, it didn't work, but when I looked for documentation, I found a way to do it - I should read the documentation well because it could have saved me more time, but I don't care. Then I worked on the budgeting site - This is where I learned about env variables and how to use them in nuxt, I also learned that we have to use npm run generate to generate a dist folder. Now I have the site on netlidy - budgeting-site.netlify.app, but I still need to fix some functions, and then I could focus on the cru bot and dr. Qian's site, I really want it to be cool and perfect, I have to look and see if there are more bugs, and I also want to make the code easier to read. Also I can't understand how the code works sometimes xD, and I have to review it. But now I want to take a shower, see you tomorrow guy. I also downloaded AY I CAN'T REMEMBER THE BOOK AGAIN, but now I can understand it better, and I just need to read it slowly. O and I played sky with nyny and we talked about their work

    Entry: Oh I'm fine, but I think I wasted the day, you know what I mean? Actually, I read, wrote code, played beatsaber and echo vr - I'm getting a lot better, I didn't cook because there was already food. Kimberly from fitness street server has a boyfriend now xD. My shoulder is a bit sore, but it doesn't hurt. Hmm, the weather today was really really nice, it rained, but not much. I also watched a few episodes of hundred days to fall in love, and there are many many actors from betty in ny xD, it's really funny, and now, I like it, not as much as betty in ny, but I like it. And I still feel like I wasted the day ;-;, I think it's about how I ended the day, but tomorrow I have to work, and sometimes, I feel stressed, but not much, just a little bit. I also played sky with lama and sergey for a while. Oo and I learned some things about birds from woodpeckers

    Entry: I have good news, I finished the new testament!! But I want to reread hebrews and romans, why? Because yes. I played echo vr and it was very fun. I started reading, I can't remember the name ;-; but the book by Carlos Ruiz and the spanish is more complex, I don't know many of the words and I can't follow the story, I can only get a vague idea of ​​the plot and I don't like it :(, I'll try to reread it, and I'll try to learn the common words. I also feel much better than yesterday, I resisted the temptation, and I was somewhat productive. Now I want to take a shower, tomorrow I'll try to watch more vue Mastery videos- I don't know if I've said it but the lessons are free during this week, ehhh I started and finished the second season of one 0unch man, and I'm almost done with made in abyss. But then I want to restart hajime no IPPO and read the opm manga. Next week will mark the halfway point of the internship, and it seems to be going really fast, now I'm going to take a shower because my younger brother wants to use the bathroom too. Tomorrow I'll try to finish the user goals feature on my site, then I'll work on making the site usable on a small screen. Oh I want to finish the book, and at least, will improve my vocabulary!

    My mood bad
    
    Entry: Okay I1 dont aant to write in Spanish cause what I wanna say is gonna be long and ranty. I feel like I've been losing my self control lately, like losing it a lot, down the drain, I feel myself saying it started when I started reading the gita which talks about selfish desires and the more I think bout my.actions, the more I willingly surrender to them, the temporary pleasures like not working out or eating a cookie.  Before, I'd keep myself from.eating the cookie, and even though I know rhat that's not my goal anymore, I find myself finding it harder and harder to control my urges, for example playing chess, i reached 1400 finally! But kept.playing and losing and losing back to 1330, 70 ELO! and I know that's how gambling must feel, and it feels horrible eugh, not as bad as other feelings. But horrible none the less. Another example is working out, today I had to push myself harder to workout than I have in a while, actually not today, since I got my vr, I'm planning on moving my routine towards more boxing based, but considering how things aregoing, I'm finding it hard to stick to one routine,   In learning new things, I think I'm still as proactive, I was on a call with mystic elephant from the cru server about the discord bots, and apart from that, vue mastery has free courses through the weekend and I'm using it to get at least a basic understanding into new features like render functions, my italian learning has slowed and I still havent listened to language transfer in a while. Maybe the problem is my routine. Of which I have none, oh and for my budget app, I was only able to get the expenses graph done and couldnt think of a way to properly have a net income graph, maybe I should scrap it, or make it so that it overlays both graphs so the user can see when their spending is whack, something like that? But apart from that, my self control has been absolutely horrible, and nothing has really suffered from it. I even stopped reading the Gita because I am honestly finding it too vague, repetitive, and although I really enjoyed the premise once it began, I'm quickly growing bored of it, and I'm gonna start another carlos Ruiz zafon book en espanol.   I hope recruitment isnt next week, if it is , I'm prolly not gonna go. I didnt work on dr qians site today. And ughhh I keep saying I'll do ... tomorrow- side note, removed the mods from my beatsaber - but after the first half of the day, it aall usually goes to trash, like I was watching made in abyss while coding but didnt get far, I did a 10 mins yoga session and spent more than 2 hours in vr, hmmm. Maybe I'm too hard on myself for just relaxing, but then again. Relaxingndoesnt mean letting go of willpower! I still dont feel like I've achieved anything saying all this too, and I know that God willing I wake up tomorrow - ugh I should start bringing God more and more into my life, like, right now I'd say I'm inna state of desolation, and it could be the heat talking but it's not even super hot, another thing, I feel like my anger has been growing strongrr! Like lil things will make me wanna get angry and then biting my nails, now I'm more like filing my nails with my teeth, another sign of losing will power. Imma go head to bed now though, after reading the bible of course. I need to wake up with a fresh head and hopefully have dreams

    Entry: Today i want to write in english :(, noo. I taught boostrap to students and it confused them a lot, but we played a tiktok drama game- something like that, and that or this. There is a ddos ​​attack on sky, I hope it gets resolved soon. I played beatsaber but it keeps crashing and it's very annoying, I want to update the game and remove mods. I worked on OHM - outsmarting human mind.s.. - and now, the code is getting more complex!! And it confuses me and it's annoying, but it's okay, and i'm going to finish the js course in maybe two days, also i'll finish the bible reading challenge and finish the new testament in 90 days :). I'm also almost done with the budgeting site, i'll work on the graphics tomorrow. The Gita confuses me a lot, well, i get confused because i can't figure out selfish acts from selfless acts. I don't know, now i'm going to sleep, i'm sleepy

    My mood Meh
    
    Entry: Oh my mom makes me mad!! But but I have to calm down, she ruined my mood a bit, but it's okay, oh I shouldn't think about it anymore because it only causes more hate and frustration. Today's class was very interesting. We did riddles! And I did the build your robot activity and it was very very funny and interesting. Hmmm what else, I played beat saber and I finally beat bang bang on expert plus, how exciting. I also played thrill of the fight - my muscles feel sore, so I didn't do my normal routine, but totf it was very intense, and I was sweating a lot. I worked on the bot, but I didn't do much m, I also worked on the quotes site - I didn't write any code for Dr. Qian's site but that's because I'm still waiting for her to respond to me. I'll work on the remaining graphics tomorrow, and then I'll try to finish the user goals feature. I deleted brave from my phone, actually, I want to, but I don't think I can, see how much my flight skills have improved. Oh I see that two years ago, many things have changed, but other things have not changed, my mother is the same, she doesn’t listen and just wants to be heard, but I think now, she doesn’t react to me much, she still makes me angry and it’s obvious, but I try to understand her- even if it’s difficult. I also wanted to be a vegetarian two years ago, but you and I both know that that never happened, why not? Well I think it’s because I have lost, or at least my awareness of nature has diminished, and I see things with a more nihilistic eye, and I haven’t watched Kristina Lynn’s videos for a long time, and to be honest, I think it’s because she, and other people, represent a part of my life that I want to achieve, but I haven’t been able to achieve it. I want a garden, and I want to study environmental sustainability, and now I study CS. And I like it, but I also think about the lost opportunities, and sometimes I wonder how my life would have gone :(. I know I shouldn't give up!!!! Oh in the past, I said that when I have money, I will donate it, but that hasn't happened :(, I remember that I made a promise with Gilbert, and I want to follow it, oh I need to read the bible and go to sleep, maybe I will continue it tomorrow, but now I have changed in the sense that I don't think I can make a big difference :¡ maybe it's true, but maybe not@

    Entry: Ooo there's a new update, I don't know if I like it, but it's okay, It's something new.. .We should welcome changes with open hands.&nbsp;..I made a lot of stuff today! I started making a discord bot, because MysticElephant - from CRU server - wants to make a bot for cru. I had a bug but he helped me fix it - I had to update my node.js package. And I had an idea, I want to make a bot that will remind me of Dr. Mina's assignments, and when I have to do them. There's a horrible smell in the bathroom. So today, I finally completed most of Dr. Qian's assignments, I don't know how to deal with some problems, but I have time to do it. I also made fettuccine spaghetti and it tasted really good. My brother just went into the bathroom ;-;. It's hot today, but not anymore, actually, it's kinda cold, and I like it :). The electrical outlets weren't working for maybe five hours, but someone fixed it, and now I think it's my mother who has gone to the bathroom. Oh it's been a long time since I listened to language transfer lessons :(.&nbsp;..I didn't work on my budgeting site, but actually, I think it's almost done, I just need to make two charts, the place for the user goal, and then I'll be done. Then I might focus on discord bots, or I might start another project...Also sky's wanderlust is the guy with the cap with little lights! And he has the flute!! How exciting. Now I want to take a shower, I played beat saber, but I didn't have a chance to exercise, my boobs and legs feel sore ;-;, I'll continue my routine. Now I'm doing 100 pushups, 30 chinups, and 75 jump squats. I actually find it great. I don't have to think about the routine much.&nbsp;..What else,&nbsp; hmmm, I remembered the video for SCP, so I don't have to do it tomorrow! Actually, I'm feeling pretty proud of myself. And now I'm learning something new!! I can work on it after the internship, or when I have more free time from my job as Dr. Qian...I have other projects I want to do!!! I'm going to take a shower! Bye

    Entry: Hioooo I'm fine!! I've been reading the Gita, and it's making me think. I can't really tell if my actions are selfish or not, I need to learn how to figure it out. The internship call went really well! I found out that lanihya likes bobs burger!!! How cool and funny. I'm trying to finish all the episodes of the show. Also Roy shakked released a new song - play on - and I really like it. I guess in the future, I'll look at this moment and think- wow, that was a year ago?? But I don't feel like writing much, so I'll just shower, brush my teeth, and sleep, hopefully I'll wake up in the morning! O But before I go, I have to say that I started my routine, but I can't find where I found it!! It seems that the book superfunctionsl training doesn't say anything about 100 pushups, 150 squats... it has to be there, but I can't find it. It's so weird!! But it's okay, it's okay.

    Entry: Hey hey, come on, I'm fine. Thank you. I didn't do much today, I started hundred days to fall in love? Something like that, to improve my spanish. I played beat saber and echo vr - it's really really fun. I want to buy super hot. Hmm, tomorrow I have my internship call, everything's going to be fine. At least I don't have to go with alexis and jade 👀😞😅. I still don't know if they fixed their issues. Or and I finally played factorio! I'm trying to automate black science? I don't know. Hmm it's been a long time since I played roblox..I'll try to play it once in the future. Other than that, I haven't done anything today, I can't wait to start my workout routine again. All in all, I think today went by in a blur?

    Entry: Oh my stomach hurts a bit, I didn't do much today, I had a call with jas... but it only lasted maybe forty minutes. I played a little sky with loule, watched persona 4 and a series called vermeil de light or something, it's pretty new. I ate a lot, but now that doesn't affect my mood much. I'm still learning italian with duolingo, and no today I didn't read. I also haven't really practiced my spanish, I don't read quora as much as I used to, and I don't listen to many profe dele.es lessons, but it's okay, I'm doing this. I actually can't wait to get back to Udm, I don't talk to ethan much anymore...caleb, ben - talked to him today, and it seems he wants to buy a new computer. I wish him luck. I played a little beat saber but I also cleaned my headphones. I wrote code for the quote site, and I think I'm almost done with the basics. I need to add a function - to track user goal, oops! And I need to make a chart for the expenses. I wonder if I can try the AP Spanish test. Next week, I will start my normal routine!! And I don't want anything to stop me, I can't feel weak, maybe I need to change my attitude! I also started Vinland Saga and it's very very interesting, and today I'm not in the bathroom because my mother is using it.

    Entry: Oh oh oh oh I HAVE A LOT TO SAY!! Today, I don't know if I want to write in Spanish or English, I want to convey a lot of emotions, but I'll start at the beginning. I woke up, thank God, and went to school, we arrived at Belle Isle, and I went with Najat and Jade, but that's when the problems started. We didn't want to distribute a lot of papers, and they - well Jade wanted to hide the papers - flyers - that she didn't distribute in her car. I didn't want to do that, so I went to put some papers in the windshield of the cars. Then I went to Alexis' car, and I told her that we were resting because Najat wasn't feeling well, and she accepted it, we drove to school and I came back home. But that's when the problems started - I also did yoga and played beat saber hehe - but Alexis sent a message saying that she was disappointed, and at first, I felt really really bad because I was the one who told her that we were resting, but I thought that she didn't care. But, it seems not, I tried to calm the situation down and said that I was going to make the upcoming recruitment event better, and actually, I do want to talk to people because I’ve been really shy, but then, Jade sent a message that called out Alexis for making her wait last time, and since then, the situation eased up, at least Alexis sent me a message saying that she appreciated me, and actually, I understand her because Dr Qian isn’t here and Alexis has a lot to do, but I also think that she started the situation, but I don’t know, I don’t want to worry, but that’s not all for today. Sky released a new update!!! And it’s really cute but the sky chat people are being really negative, and it makes me a little bit angry, but I can’t do anything, I tried to play VR chat with Hansel but it didn’t work. I don’t want to talk too much about the drama, because actually, it doesn’t affect me!! And there’s nothing to say actually. Oh and I thought today was Saturday, but I can relax tomorrow, but I think I'll have a lot of free time, I haven't really started the tour, but the introduction is very interesting and thought provoking. I also miss working out with Ben!!! But now my fingers hurt.

    Entry: I like the new colors. But I finally watched the Bobs Burgers movie!!! It was amazing and interesting and scary and I still love the songs and the animation was great! I don't have my call tomorrow - dr qian also cancelled our call today, and I actually like that. Buuuut, I have to go to school because Alexis and the other people from the lab are doing another recruiting event, but at least it's at UDM and I don't have to go to belle isle, but I also have a call at twelve in the afternoon, and I don't know how I'm going to do it, but let's see dude. Today I found an oob on sky, made pizza, played beat saber, wrote code- actually, I don't know if there's anything I need to do for Dr. Qian's site. But that just means I have more time for my budgeting site now. I also have some really good news, today I dreamed in spanish, well, just for a second, I have it in my dream journal, but I spoke spanish in my dream! And it was spanish well, that's a step forward in my dreams!! I'm also starting to read the Gita. However, I have to say that since I got my VR, I haven't paid much attention to my exercise routine, and I need to replace it ouch! It's just that I feel like my muscles are in a perpetual state of pain xd, and I need to rest them. I'll try to do my routine tomorrow, and see how it goes.

    Entry: Today, I feel good, I did the interview, and actually, I don’t think I did it well, but it’s okay, I don’t care that much, tomorrow is going to be the last day for work this week, Richard gave me my giftcard and I gave it to my mother. After work, I was a little productive today, AY I feel like I’m going to forget this but I have my call with Dr. Qian tomorrow, right after work, AY I can’t forget! I’ll set a reminder, a lot of reminders so I don’t forget. I also finished At Days Close! And I can finally start Bhagavats Gita. I hope it’s a good book, and after reading it, I want to read a book in Spanish, because I haven’t done it for a while, I want to take a shower now, but today, I could get rid of my worries, and that’s something I want to continue, I don’t want to think too much about things, you know? I know that worrying is not going to help me, but sometimes I can’t control it!! It’s something I need to work on – I forgot to put the “before” in this sentence. But I got light yagami in karuta, I played sky and oh sorry but I bought the earrings but I won the rainbow headphones. I also played beat saber! And I finally started boxing again because my elbows don’t hurt as much anymore. But I didn’t do yoga, I used vr for cardio? Something like that. I’ve been listening to language transfer lessons for a long time – last week and I want to get back to it! Now that I have my internship, I need to develop a schedule, when I wake up, I watch vue course videos, then, I get on the journi call, I work. OH and I want to say this, I like the other assistants, but I have to say that they don’t know how to code in html/CSS – or at least, they don’t know much about it, because jas made a lot of mistakes, Sarah is good, Nikah doesn’t talk much, but I have to say that we are a great team. I don't want to shower because I've showered before - because I sweated a lot when I played beatsaber, but I'm putting my legs in cold water, I made pizza today too. I saw shae - the one from journi. And I think that's it, I've realized even more that worrying isn't going to help me, and I should just think of things as without, and I should see them as things that will come in their time, because that's what they are. That probably doesn't make sense.

    Entry: Ok ok, I don't feel too bad, but Richard texted me and asked if I could come to Margrove for an interview, and I said yes - I'm still waiting for my mom to reply, but yes, and at first, I felt bad, because I didn't want to do it, I just want to relax and enjoy the day after school. But I remember when I'm bored, I feel even worse, I just got an email, but yes I can do it! And I'm really hungry, but there's really nothing to eat! It's frustrating. I'll be fine!! I'm not going to think too much about everyone.

    Entry: I'm about to finish at days close, and after I finish it, I'll read the Gita - I hope it's a good book. I guess summer is draining my energy! I feel pretty lethargic, but there's a part of me that has energy, but it's very small. How I feel about my internship, I don't know dude, I don't know. It's just that, I like to talk and teach, but it takes up a lot of my summer and my free time, and usually after the call, I feel lethargic, but I can say that I've been productive before class starts, but after, I usually play beat saber, chat on discord, watch YouTube, write code - I haven't had the chance to continue my project, and I think I shouldn't worry about how I feel. Many times I don't understand my emotions and now I have to accept that I won't always understand my emotions and why I feel the way I feel, but that's okay, I just need to stay busy and happy,

    Entry: Overall, I've been pretty productive today, first, the class was pretty good, it was very fast paced, and we had to improvise. Afterwards, I did yoga, made beef with rice and corn, wrote code and made the changes for the implicit associations site - dr Qian asked me to remove the practice tests, and I've already done that, but I still need to do it for the IBT. Also, I registered for vue forge and have already set up my accounts. Actually, today was really fast, but it's okay, it's okay, nothing special happened, oh what a lie, the new season of sky is very difficult but also fun, I'm very happy, today I didn't buy the pass because I don't want to waste money and I can get the cosmetics I want for free, now I'm going to take a shower, but :( It seems that I won't have my shower :(, I'm not in the mood, hmm I'm trying to find out why my mood has decreased, meh I don't know, and I'm not always going to know why I don't feel great, but I know that I laughed a lot today, and although the internship took most of the day, I could be productive, learn new things, I didn't play beatsaber, I want my elbows to rest, my knees

    Entry: Hi, I had a dream about adeniyi and vicsum and he had a VR and there was a train and snapchat and I texted my mom and had to run but luckily I was close to school. But on a different note, I didn’t do much today, I think when I have productive days, my mood is much better like yesterday! But I also know that I need rest days, and it’s okay when I do nothing and relax. So, I finished the boys – what an interesting and intense series! I played beat saber – got new sabers. My elbow still hurts and I need to do something about it, I had a short call with jas and sarai, my internship starts tomorrow! I’m not that excited but it’s something to do and it will mean I can make a schedule around the internship times. And the new season of sky starts tomorrow!! I'm not really excited because I already know everything that's going to happen, but it's ok, I don't have to go to school anymore, or pick up food, but that would just mean no more food in the house :(, I hope and WANT mofe to do it, but you and I both know that's not going to happen, unless my mom tells him he has to. I couldn't resist the temptation twice, I've been playing factorio for a long time! Beat saber takes up most of my time. But nothing bad happened today! Everyone is safe, I didn't have much to do, I think that's all for today, I want to take a shower, I'm not feeling too happy but it's ok, tomorrow I'll start my job- finally!! But I'll also be able to have more time to be productive and all that good stuff, we don't have to turn on our camera

    Entry: Great! Everything went according to plan! I went to the SCP building and the meeting was very very fun, time passed quickly, then Alexis picked me up, and she drove past the guard and it was very funny when she realized she had to face him again, but luckily, there was another person there and we passed without problems. SCP paid me, and after I got home, oh my phone battery is very low, but I played beat saber and it was very very very fun!! I found new songs - ones from the simpsons and megalovania it was very interesting! I talked to nyny about languages ​​and I'm very glad to talk to her because we haven't talked for a while, now I'm going to take a shower because I need to charge my phone to read the bible, but today, I've been productive, I had a lot of fun, and I didn't worry much, now to take a shower! Bye

    Entry: hello hello hello, how are you? I'm fine too, I'm glad to hear that :). I guess I have to say this but I had a four hour call!! Yeah really long, but really, I had nothing to do with that time, so I made money, planned for the internship, and talked to jas and sarai. I like them, there's not much I have to do, but jasmine wants to plan the first week, and we have to fix a few things. Other than that, today I played beat saber with new songs!! I like it a lot! I've also decided - and I have to applaud myself because I told my plan to my mom and dad, and they agreed! So I need to wake up early and go to the scp place, then alexis is going to pick me up there, - I already asked her and she agreed! Then I'll go to belle isle - if there's no wifi, I'll ask her if I can use her hotspot. I'm sure she'll say yes! And so I can contact my parents, then, she’ll drop me off at udm, and from there, I can get an Uber. And now, it’s time to worry because this weekend, I’m going to be really busy, I have my adventures on Saturday, and I have to call Jas and Sarai about the show on Sunday- and it’s probably going to last for the whole day- or at least until it’s really late. Well, this can be a good thing too! I’m usually bored during the weekend, and I finally have something to do! And sure, it’ll take time out of my day, but I usually just spend that time scrolling through YouTube and watching useless videos. Now, I can contribute to my cravings to be busy, but I can also have time to relax. Another thing that worries me a little bit is that the show is going to last for 6 weeks! And when it ends, I’ll only have maybe two weeks until school starts. I know, I know, when I started the break, I thought I would have more time, and I had a lot of time actually, I did a lot of things, I won't talk about them today, but I did a lot of things! And I've improved a lot, so I shouldn't feel bad, I'm glad I had the chance to rest a lot, and that doesn't mean I won't have time to rest when I start classes! I miss the food from tdr, and I'll finally be able to go to the gym, also when I finish my programs, I would have earned more money - although now, money doesn't worry me that much, and I want to keep it that way. I can also go to the basement of the library. There are a lot of things I'll be able to do, but I'll also have to study, but that will mean I'll learn new things!! So I feel calm now, I'm going to take a shower!! I love writing in the bathroom! I feel calm and relaxed, I can't wait for the future, or at least, for tomorrow - hopefully -> another thing I've learned, I'll start saying - God willing - or something like that when I talk about the future,

    Entry: Maybe I should start writing my posts in the bathroom because I feel calm here xd, there is a particular smell that fills me with nostalgic emotions. Memories of wildlife buddies days :*). Maybe there is a universe where I decided to pursue wildlife biology. But you know. It also makes me think of things I haven't thought of before, I should stop saying - today has been..., not because of grammar, but because that would mean I can reduce the whole day in just one sentence, then I'll stop saying it. Today, things happened, and time has gone, I saw Richard and Eddie - he's working on an AR game, I think it's going to be very successful, and I hope so! Because it's obvious that he works hard. I can finally use custom songs in beat saber and it's very fun. I'll continue my previous routine tomorrow. I've also started thinking about the present, and I'm not really sure I want to stop doing that, I think I'll only think about the future when I want to plan something, but still, sometimes it causes me unnecessary stress. Or and the landlord has fixed the electrical outlets. I code a little bit, but it's okay, I want to shower now, but tomorrow- o! I can always reserve time to think about the future, like now when I write! So tomorrow I don't have much to do, I have my NAF call with Jasmine and we're going to plan the initial weeks. I won't go to school, and I'll exercise - I'll also play beatsaber, duh. But lately, my elbow hurts, I think it's because I don't stretch it before exercising or playing beatsaber, I hope it goes away really fast. I got a lot of food today, croissants!! I also haven't played factorio much!! I'm still learning Italian - I got a little confused but I think it's just because I don't practice much!! And I'm not trying to understand how to use verbs... I'll get it with more time. I think that's all, see you later.

    Entry: Good news! I decided to restart my old routine!! And I’ll tell you why. First, I don’t like my new routine, today, it caused my knees to hurt, and I couldn’t finish it, I don’t have enough resources/tools to do it, and when I try to do the exercises without the recommended tools, it makes me feel like the exercises aren’t working, and compared to my old routine, I feel worse after the exercise instead of better. I also met up with Linu and he told me that he gained more muscles!! And I know that the new routine didn’t help with that xd. Speaking of Linu, I went to Detroit Shopping Compsby - a restaurant- with the new Seed students, and with Andre, Andreh, and Linu. It was really fun and I ate dumplings, and something called sticky rice. I also had a call with Jas from Journali and we’re going to have a call tomorrow. I think I've discovered something new, when I have tabs open in Chrome, they make me feel overwhelmed, and I end up thinking too much about the topic! Now, I've decided that after I've learned something, I'll close the tab, and I'll just leave it in my memory. Oh, there are two things that are exciting me, first, I started learning about how to use the composition API in Vue, and I registered for a Vue hackathon! But it's during my internship time, and I won't be able to contribute much, but still, I want to see how other people write code in Vue, and I want to be proficient!! I keep reading - at days close, times in night past - and it's very interesting! I also want to keep learning German. And I feel proud of myself because I told my mother that I have to go to Belle Isle on Saturday, and I didn't procrastinate too much. I used what I wrote before and I decided that if something won't cause me harm, I will do it!!! And I need to stop procrastinating, and I also just discovered something called - mahabharata - and I want to read it - with the Gita. Now I want to take a shower, I'm excited to get back into my routine, but I still can't throw punches without hurting my hands. In realised, I think today was a great day, I woke up - and I think I should say that this is also very important, I woke up and I have all my abilities and I can walk, see, breathe, think... without problems, I made mashed potatoes - mashed potatoes with gravy, I was very productive, I started the bills section of my site, and I got an idea for the site I want to make next, I read, someone complimented me. I ate delicious and tasty food, I talked to other people. There was a little bit of stress because I'm learning how to use dark mode on websites, but stress is my fault and I can easily avoid it, I think since I untapped it, I'm not thinking about it much anymore. I should use this technique more often I just took a shower and I feel so light and amazing, I have discovered the advantages of silent meditation, I love how I have developed and grown, my thoughts and my ways of learning, and surprisingly, I still miss savvyy, I am still looking for my way of life, and it will always change, and now that I do what I think, I feel happy

    Entry: Oh now I'm going to write in Spanish, I have a call tomorrow at four in the afternoon, but I also have to go to school because I have the meeting with Dr. Hill and the new SEED students. Actually, I don't know if I can go, my mother hasn't told me much, and it's possible that I can't go, because I won't be able to talk to her, hmm. I can use a friend's phone to call her, but I think I should be able to go! The soccer game will end at nine, it's very late, so, I can't say or guess what she's going to say to me, yes I want to go, but I also have a call and I want to do it, I also want to stay home! I have to wake up early tomorrow to talk to her, I can't or shouldn't worry, it won't solve anything. I'm going to sleep, I know that I have to continue with what I was doing yesterday, but I'm going to say it tomorrow or I don't know.

    Entry: Happy 4th of July, there are fireworks, but I don't feel the magic! It's like, they don't make me feel happy anymore, and I know it's ridiculous, external things shouldn't contribute or influence my happiness, but that's life!! I can't control it, and now I'm using Bobs Burgers music to cheer me up, and it's working a lot!! But I know I shouldn't depend on it, ay recently I've been feeling bad, or at least, better. What has caused this? Well you and I are going to find the answer. What have I done lately. I did nf for 6 days, bought a vr, went to Daniel's house- I think this contributed a lot, journali is going to start next week, and I don't have a current schedule, or I don't have any friends I can talk to. Well I have the server but you understand me, and I don't think I've discussed it much because ay I don't know, I'm going to write in English. I haven't been having deeper conversations about myself, and maybe be writing in Spanish is limiting that because I am subconsciously limiting the amount of words I wanna say/should say, but I have been feeling pretty shitty lately. Even a bit about my Spanish now. Okay we are going to talk about it in a few categories, about the changes I've made, what has stayed the same, and how its affecting me Physical - we will start with working out, I started the summer with the one program in mind and stuck with it for about 2 months, was able to shorten my time by basically half, but now I've found that, and in reality I always knew that I wasn't really working out for muscle, more muscle endurance and strengthening my heart, then I got the vr and realized that it could be my new sort of cardio, pretty fun and can be longer duration cardio too, I had stopped focusing on prs a while ago and focused on getting the shortest time possible, not going nearly close enough to failure usually and sometimes forsaking form. Now with the new routine, it's much easier, it's with more difficult exercises for shorter reps and longer rest times, I didn't give it 100 percent today which wasn't the best but I wanted to feel out the different exercises and their effect on my body, I might do that for the rest of the week, but that schedule of my routine and my goal for the routine has kind of faded away and I'm starting a new one, which isn't bad! I am pretty disappointed that I wasn't able to do it to the 6 minute mark, but I do know that in the long run, it's going to do me no great service, compared to having my vr cardio and the normal routine, which would hopefully build muscle and make me stronger, combined with yoga. I also am feeling pretty normal with my body, it hasn't changed significantly, at least in my eyes, over the summer, and it hasn't gotten significantly worse either, its maintaining its form, which is pretty okay, I want to make progress and I'm well aware that bodyweight isnt the way to go most of the time, but I'm making/at peace with it. I would like to go to the gym but I'm also not gonna think too much about that. About totf boxing, I think I overdid it with less than ideal technique, throwing jabs hurts my elbows so I'm resting it up and gonna work on the technique, also my thumbs are burning oof xd. Hmm physically, I still really want to resist temptation just like before, I felt really weirdly different and I want to reach that again. Also I'm now pretty indifferent to the hot weather, lately it hasn't been super hot, but I'm better at tolerating it. I imagine my productivity would also go under physical here. Essentially, I haven't been the most productive, usually spending time scrolling through quora or watching youtube compilations videos! I am working on the budget site which is great, and I've made some breakthroughs, it's coming along, even if it's quite slowly. Theres also the weird feeling after I've done something and look back at it wondering how I was able to achieve it, I just have to remember that I know the fundamentals and I know where to look when I have problems with something/need to implement something. I am very close go fleshing out the site for the research, and I'm happy with it, its nothing special and I have to make sure the data is accurate, it is a very very low grade worry, but it is still there. I have also kept reading and learning Spanish, even though its not to the quality I would have liked, but thats fine! Any progress is better than nothing, same with language transfer and working in Italian! Also the vue course is in a bit of a standstill. Moving forward, how can I prevent myself from feeling back physically, well there will always be times where I feel like this, and I believe that what matters is that I know what I want, and how I can achieve it, if I am feeling bad about my body, I know it is temporary and there are always things that I can work on, I should be fine with the progress I'm making, regardless of whether it's slow, I should thrive to be better though, be a bit more productive to learn and achieve what I want Social/Friends - th is is a bit more shaky grounds, the majority of my interaction with people are on discord,.I havent been in the mood lately to socialize, especially when the charging ports stopped working and I got into the slump, I haven't had the change to talk to vex or hansel really,, talking with the people.in the duck is.pretty nice, but I have been feeling quite disconnected, like theres no one to talk non superficially with. Also instead of just saying all this, I would rather come up with things to do moving forward, I'll try to talk more deeply so that it's not just weird empty talk with others, and I can take time away without feeling guilty!!  Environment - this might be what is affecting me the most, in the positives, it is much better than Nigeria, we do have free wifi, constant electricity, opportunities, nicer things in general, but in the negatives, we do live in a pretty trash place, half the ports arent working, which has proven to bring out the creative side in us and the two fans in the room is pretty nice, the visit to Daniel's and his brothers? House was pretty demotivating cause they're basement looks nicer than our living room; but life will always be like that, thered always be something better and I need to be happy with what I have! Our toilet can be nicer than someone else's living room, i do try to be more.positive, it might be harder now that our mum is now here most of the day, I really enjoy Saturdays and my times with myself though. I want to travel and try new things but that's nothing new and you and I already know that, its something you've craved for years and will crave for years more, hard truths and no way around that, I doubt our immigration details will be able to get sorted properly before I turn 20! Quite pessimistic but it is looking to be that way now, I blame no one at all, we are here and thays enough, sometimes I still find myself wondering how we are here and how cool it is, but other times I'm not that positive, I'd love to move to a nice place with a nice medium sized house in a forest with peace and quiet, that'll come.next tho, I might actually keep the remaining for tomorrow, this is quite long and I wanna read the bible.   Mental/emotionally   Gaining summer wisdom   Current outlook of the world   Future outlook   __________________   Okay so here are some things I've learned about myself physically, socially and environmentally   - no matter what my current physique or position is, itll always change, for the better or for the worse, I get to decide that with my choices   - worrying doesn't help or add an hour to your life   - it's fine to take a social break and reflect on your life   - try to be productive but remember that you shouldn't judge yourself too much off it, productive days are amazing and unproductive days can be just as amazing, finding the balance is key! And a good schedule and plan helps  - You have had wanderlust for a while now and it's not going away, make the best with what you have!  Enjoy new normal experiences, long drives in the car or peeling potatoes for a new meal   - in a positive note, the word of God has really improved the quality of my life and my inner voice!  I still have the feeling that I havent resolved anything though, meaning I havent touched yet on the issue, or at least discussed a lot of it, maybe it has to do with my parents/relationship with siblings, I'll try to be as thorough as possible in the next entry just to be sure that future me knows all my current thoughts and feelings, it might even spill to wednesday

    Entry: At first, I felt very negative, a little emotionally clouded, I didn't want to talk and was just talking to myself - very confusing for me, I haven't used it much. Then I played beatsaber, bought some songs, and watched ciecus de soleil, it was very interesting and surprisingly emotional. I couldn't play totf because my hands or elbow hurt, then I watched some simpsons episodes and I love them as always. Recently I haven't wanted to play sky with other people, and when I see them, I take off the v:¡ game. But now I'm going to read, and sleep!! I still don't know when the landlord is going to fix the electrical outlets!!

    Entry: This is a new emotion, because I feel like this! I mean I don't know how I feel, so at least I can tell you what happened today - not bad. Well, I made some food, and I found out that we were going to Daniel's house. But, did we go to his brother's house? And it was near the lake, it's really nice, Chris Albert was there, I don't know why. Uh, all the people there were white people, and I felt really weird, and a little bit angry?? I don't know and I don't know if I can communicate my thoughts in Spanish but I don't want to write in English, so, it's like, they are the definition of WASP - I hope future me understands that. But they are really rich, and ugh now that I'm writing this, I feel stupid and dumb and ugh, it's kind of peculiar ugh, why am I judging them?? They are successful! And I'm not going to hate them for it, but it's not hate. It's something new, I don't think I've felt that way much in the past. It’s like I think they don’t deserve it, and that their life should be easy and happy?? I know, it’s stupid, believe me, I know, maybe I’m just jealous, they have a big house and I want to live in a place like that, it’s nice, and calm, or maybe I want my parents to live like that- I doubt that this is the problem but I’m trying!!! Actually, I’m going to forget about it, it’s not going to or shouldn’t affect my life, buuuut what’s going to affect my life is that now I don’t know if I want to work in an office or for myself. Or maybe I hate the way I live now and I don’t want to face it!!! I actually hate it, well now, and I know that sometimes I don’t care and I feel happy, but I don’t have space, now there are bedbugs, the neighborhood is dirty, many of the electrical sockets aren’t working, there are weird bugs, there’s only one room for five people, BUT, I know that I shouldn’t feel so discouraged, and I just need to focus on the positive aspects of my life. I have technology and I'm learning new things, living in Nigeria is going to be much worse!! I can cook whenever I want, there are many things I can do, and I have to live like I live in Alaska :*). Sorry for this negative post, and I'll make sure I'm still a positive person.

Well, I stayed there for an hour, because the room was cold and very calm. And now, why do I feel bad? Because my brother has done something that stops the electrical ports from working and now, I can't charge my phone, I can't use the WiFi- at ​​least I have xfinity, and I have my scp meeting tomorrow!! I have to remember it, I have a sense that I won't remember it, but I want to go there, and I want to charge my computer - and maybe my phone, I don't know. I did yoga and it was very very relaxing!! I almost fell asleep. I'm finally working on the chart on my budgeting site, and in general, I don't know what I'm doing, but it's working. I don't want to kill my phone's battery.

I didn't work out but I want to change my routine and I found a new routine - from Reddit - and I'll try it tomorrow, well, maybe next week. My mom didn't go to work today, I finished the italian course on language transfer! And I downloaded the german course because I want to learn it, but I also want to practice italian, and spanish ;-;, it's like an addiction. It's pretty late eugh, I've been scrolling reddit for maybe half an hour. I have to go to school tomorrow, well I don't really need to go, but I want to go, I want to finish my homework because my journi internship will start next week after next week I had the call with dr qian, and it seems like there's not much to do anymore! I just need to make a few changes and that'll be it. It will mean I won't make any more money, but that's okay, I don't care that much. I also feel proud of myself because I have kept up the habit of writing in Spanish, and I think it has improved my Spanish, although now I don't learn as much as I would like, but that's okay!

I felt pretty bored, well, lazier, it's like I have no energy to do anything!! I just wanted to watch bobs borges and eat food. I read bnha manga and the berserk one. Now I'm going to talk about ben, I've attached - attached - the image of our conversation, and sometimes, it seems to me that ben is a... big ass kisser xd. You see, I like ben a lot, a lot, but he's like Eddie - I don't know why but... well I'm going to continue, I've already written that he considers me as his motivation and always, well not always, but usually overestimates my abilities and gives unnecessary compliments;-; It's weird and pointless for me to argue about it, but many times, I feel like he's being insincere, you know? That's all.

After that, I walked to margrove- it took 20 minutes and I got really sweaty and smelled horrible. Sky posted an update, and I played beatsaber and thrill of the fight. Totf was really interesting and I was sweating a lot. Eddie richard and demonshae commented on my muscles and made me feel validated.

I tried and bought the thrill of the fight, I don't know how to spell it in Spanish, but it's harder than I thought!!! I was able to finish the beginning - the tutorial, but my first fight, no ;-;. I'm going to keep using it, and I'd like to know and see how I improve. Oh and loule told me that he feels depressed, and I don't know how to help him, I think I shouldn't change, because if I change, everything will get very awkward :(. I hope he's okay

I didn't exercise, but it's okay, my chest hurts a little. I need to write in English to describe it. But I'm not going to do that. It's like when you want to crack a bone, and it's not cracked, but it feels like it's on the threshold. I need to figure something out. I've found that when I think about something before I sleep - like when I count/name things to sleep, I have dreams. I don't know if it's scientific, I'll try it tonight. On a different note, I feel a little preoccupied with getting the vr because I don't want to face my mom - you know how it is. And I feel like I'm not going to use it, I don't know, it's been a long time since I bought something so expensive, and I want to use it.

Also someone has replied to my emails about lab meetings and dr qian's study. Hmm I did exercise today and I did it in 11 minutes!! That's great, I think my heart is trying hard. I think I connected with vex today, he even sent a picture of his cat and didn't delete it. I'm almost done with the Italian language in language transfer, and I think I'm going to do it again. I just want a basic understanding of Italian concepts, and maybe I'll start with German because I want to know more about English and Germanic languages ​​OH Oh and I made beef with soy sauce and brown sugar. It was very delicious and I want to do it again!! I also want to add honey

    Entry: I couldn’t resist temptation and it’s hot here! I feel really heavy and I couldn’t exercise because my chest was acting weird. I have to pick up food tomorrow and I have to face uncle ben and tell him I’m not giving him money!! I have to be strong! I hope everything is okay. I don’t like the heat, but at least, I don’t need to go to school tomorrow and I’ll be able to relax, and maybe play factorio. Actually, I think we’re going to go to daniel’s house next week. I want to buy my vr!! I have to ask my dad if he has the money in his account yet. Maybe I should write in Italian, I’ve been learning it and it’s a little confusing and I don’t know a lot of the words, but I think I’ll be able to understand nyny’s conversations now because if I can understand the grammar, I could use my knowledge of spanish words to understand what she’s saying. I have to remember my perfect self, I think I don’t know who she is anymore, and I need to find her again. I also stopped reading The Brothers Karamozov because it got pretty boring and I don't feel like finishing it anymore, I'll continue with At Days Close.

Hmm, what's more, I had my lab meeting but it was quite short, I want to sleep early because I have to go to school tomorrow, like always ;-;. Why can't I enjoy my summer!! I want everything to be like it was before :*(. It's not too much to ask. I did yoga! And it was very relaxing,

    Entry: Today was very, very different. First of all, I had a weird dream - I saved it in my dream journal, but it was really weird. I took a shower, and went to school. BUT, all the doors were locked! I couldn't get into the engineering building, and later, I found out that today is a vacation day - juneteenth, and so, I came back home. But, that's not the end of the strange events. My mother came back from work, and much earlier than usual xd, I think she's been fired, or something, they're going to give her a new job. I hope it's a good job. Also now I can buy the vr! But I need to wait until my dad puts the money in his account. I played factorio, but not much, and I think now, I like the budgeting site more. I was in a state of flux, and I need to rely more on myself and my spanish skills. I'm still listening to language transfer - italian. But now I want to learn German, but I want to keep learning Spanish and Italian, maybe I need to relax, I'm losing the motivation to do Duolingo, well, Duolingo is quite boring. What I can't wait for the most is to do cardio with VR, it's going to be very interesting!! And finally we have a new partnership on the server. And I almost forgot but I have the meeting with the lab meeting tomorrow, I can't forget it!! I have to set a reminder on my watch, now I'm going to read the bible - it seems I'm losing the motivation to do it too, but I don't need the motivation, I need the discipline. And now it's like I'm writing without thinking, I want to be able to talk to other people like that in other languages!! Today was a great day. There was also a wasp

    Entry: I couldn't resist the temptation, but I still feel good and a little bit happy because now I know I can do this, and I'm not thinking about it too much anymore. I made the split tea soup, and bought another Karamov brothers test. I wrote more code for the new quote site, and now I want to create an ecommerce site. When I'm done with this site, I'll start with that, and I'll use nuxt. Speaking of nuxt, today I was confused about the difference between nuxt and vite, and I found out that vite is more general, and not just for vue, but nuxt is for vue. Actually, vite is very similar to vue CLI, and nuxt makes vue easier to use. I still feel confused and a little bit overwhelmed, but I know I just need more practice and experience - which I'll get through practice. And I want a mentor, like a Real Vue mentor. I know Daniel knows what he's doing very well, but I want someone a bit more advanced - he is advanced, but with go and back-end - at least I think that's the case. I want someone who can answer my questions like now. Tomorrow I'll do more research on vite and nuxt. I'd like to understand them if I'm going to use them.

    Entry: I resisted the temptation again! I picked up some food and made a split pea soup with potatoes and corn. It was a very tasty meal. I worked out today, and I think I broke my record too!! But when I was working out, I finished the routine on jefit by accident, but I think I did it in maybe 11 - 12 minutes. Pretty soon, I'll be able to finish it in 6!!! I needed that week off. I played factorio and the server - udm, cru and fitness street - were up. And I had my call with dr qian, and I don't have to make too many changes, but I think the changes I need to make are going to get pretty tough. I started karamov brothers, and it's kind of interesting, but nothing has happened yet, it's just introducing the characters. Richard talked to me and I need to ask my dad if I can open a bank account, and if eyitooni can do the program because it's in person. Also Mr. Ben asked me if I can lend him some money, I know I should come with a light heart, but it’s really weird and it looks like I’ll have to confront him again next week, and I need to be prepared. I’m not feeling too sore, so I guess I’ll do my routine again because I didn’t do it on Wednesday. Also I haven’t talked to- oh I forgot his name already. The one from hellotalk. I don’t feel like writing there, but here, I think I’m writing fine, and I can translate my thoughts from English to Spanish. I also had a dream that included Spanish, and I was able to translate it - well, the sentence was incorrect, but that’s not the point xD. I made a graph in excel for the sky discord and they liked it!!!

I feel like I'm going to miss it, I have to set a reminder/notification to remind me. I made two pizzas today xd, and I didn't do my normal routine because I feel sore- sore- it's better now, and I'll do my normal routine tomorrow. I have to pick up groceries tomorrow, and actually, I want to do it because it will mean we have more food!! I resisted temptation again. Five days!! I think this is my best streak!! I'm kinda excited, but I also feel like if I don't keep my motivation/discipline up, I will, and feel even worse, but I know God is going to help me. I started another book - the brothers karamov or something. I didn't buy the book about life in the night, and I still want to read it, but I want to try this new book. And I really want to see the Bob Burger movie, it's like a craving, an interesting word because it seems like before the eyes.

    Entry: Today was way more interesting. I'm proud of myself because I resisted the temptation. Joy didn't come to work today, and I almost forgot about the lab meeting. I don't know why this happens, but, when I hear bad news, even though I usually don't feel too sad, I get tears in my eyes. I have to email a few sites to ask if we can recruit people for the study. Speaking of emails, I got my journi offer at last!!! They're going to pay me 20 dollars per hour, I don't know how long I'll be working, but at least I'll be able to save money. I have my call with dr qian in two days, and I have to finish the IAT tests. I'm really glad that I was able to find a way to make the IAT tests easier, but I think I can improve it! Maybe I should write in Italian xd. I'm still learning it - obviously - I miss ugly betty a lot - well, betty in ny, you should see the original. Overall, today was pretty productive, but I haven't had the urge to write on hellotalk!!! I think it's because I'm not who I really am there, it's a dilemma xd. There's no update on sky beta OH OH OH And I finished 1984 and now, I'm starting to read a new book about the night life of people in the past! I find it very interesting and I hope I learn a lot AHHH I JUST REALIZED THAT I GRADUATED A YEAR AGO, HOW STRONG

I'm still learning Italian, and I'm going to use duolingo to do it - combined with language transfer. I felt a little lethargic, BUT, I did my workout in 13 MINUTES. GREAT, I tried using my new strategy and it worked! I just need to do the exercises without a break, and when I really need to, I'll take a minute, and just a minute. I felt like I was going to faint a little, but now it's less than when I started. And now I'm turning out to be tempted!!! I think I'll keep going like this, I know God will support me, and I don't want to stop!! If I could break this habit, I'll be very happy.

At least nothing bad happened, and I had a chance to relax without writing code or working out. Speaking of which, now I want to do something new!! It’s the same routine, but I’ll do half of it - without rest, and then, I’ll do the other half. When I did it, I was able to finish half of the routine in six minutes, if I do it twice, I hope I can break my record - if I can do the whole thing in 15 minutes!! And I can’t do 10 chinups yet, but I think I can!! I just need to warm up and do it quickly, wish me luck. If I could use this routine to improve my heart and conditioning, I will, and I should take this opportunity to do that!!

There is no reason to go to school, and I just want to go because I want to be productive, and I want to finish the survey page on dr qian's site before the weekend. Also, I can listen to language transfer lessons. Now I'm going to read the Bible, I'm reading romans, and every time I learn something new! I think I should speak more in the past tense to practice my Spanish. Johny gave me a website to practice my past tense, I also lifted a pretty heavy weight - 78lbs and it didn't feel very heavy. I want to continue my routine and I don't know what I want to do when I start lifting weights. Finally, I started gankoutsou, the monte cristo story, and it's very unique! - I don't think that means unique, I did yoga and it was very relaxing!! And now I'm dreaming more and more!

He's a really nice guy, I think 1984 is getting better, and I basically didn't do any work, and I started my budgeting project, I want to do it with typescript, but it seems to be getting more complex than I thought, well, not complex, but annoying. What I want to do is not working, and in the end, I decided to do it with vite and ts, without Vue. I want to improve my vanilla javascript, and I want to try to make a complex site without the conveniences of vue. I also want to sleep earlier, so I think I'll leave this post here, I'm learning the subjunctive tense again. WEIRDO. hmm, I think that's it, I started tracking my dreams, and ologies' advice for sleeping is quite interesting, I need to think of a category, and I need to say words from category eds in alphabetical order, like boys' names - Albert, bob... to Zine And I want to make a workout routine for when I can lift weights!

But it should be good. I helped joy with her excel work, I have to make some changes to dr qian's site, and I haven't been able to start the budgeting site, I want to start it, but, no, no, I'm not going to write excuses and pretexts! It's all my fault, I have the time, but recently, I've been feeling a little burned out, when I wake up at six-ish, I have to go to school, there, I have maybe, two hours of free time, I can use it to start the site!! And when I finish work, I'll go home, exercise, rest a little, and work on dr qian's site. It's a good plan, and I think it can work! I also need to continue the vue course, but I can do that when I'm writing the code for the budgeting site. 1984 is so boring!! And I want to stop reading it, but I hope the plot gets better. I played sky with loule, and it was really nice, we talked about Alaska and countries, I found out that he has traveled to a lot of countries, more than I thought. I hope he talks more! In sky, a new ts comes and it's the guy with the banjo and earmuffs!

I did some coding, planned the budget site, worked for joy, miao meeting tomorrow- almost forgot. Worked out, basically the same thing I did yesterday- not really, but they're starting to get indistinguishable!!!   Downloaded hellotalk and probably the most interesting part of the day was finishing undone, which is an amazinggg series. Even reading 1984 is pretty boring, at first it gave me do android's dream of electric sheep vibes, but then it just now gives me dystopian nothing is really truth information isnall false vibes and not really vibing to that . Didnt even feel overcast but essentially I need a new emotion called routine rut

Nothing bad happened, but it was all very banal, and it's not going to help the future me, or the present me. But, I listened to some language transfer lessons, and learned more Italian. Puoi means you can, and vuoi means you want. Like, non puoi venire a cazza mía? - don't you want to come to my house? My mother bought some (little things that make the house smell nice). I've coded a bit on miao's site, and I think I have a good structure now, and now, hopefully, it will be easier to add new features/tests. I have to go to school tomorrow :*0. But, I think I can do a little work, if I can hide in a class, and as a result, I can work and be productive, while waiting for ten o'clock. It's a crazy plan but it can work@

Ehh, I’m watching videos about languages. I think I’ve written this before, but, when I learn something new, I feel like I’m doing it from the point of view of [ idk much about how to translate this to Spanish, but basically the point of view of someone sharing that knowledge to someone, maybe to improve the persons view of my knowledge). It’s a bit weird, but that’s how I feel :*(. That doesn’t mean I’m going to stop learning new things! I watched a few episodes- 7 xD- of undone s2, and it’s very interesting!!

I love the story, and the plot twists - or better yet, the unexpected turns. I started watching boys s3, and played a little bit of factorio. My training session was awful. I felt really heavy, and I couldn't do the leg workout because my knees hurt :*0. One advised me to take - advised me to take a week of deload. I'm going to do it!!! I've been doing my routine for maybe eight weeks, and I think I need to rest - and I feel like my heart and muscles are going to thank me.. I saw dr hill and felt uncomfortable 👁👁, but it was good to see him again. Joy told me she was going to quit udm and wanted me to be in a good position. I also talked to my dad about the vr, and it seems that he doesn't want me to buy it, but I do want to buy it!!! And recently, I've found that I'm calmer than before, and it makes me feel happy that I've matured a bit, or at least I'd like to think so. Since I've finished the wind cover, I'm going to read 1984 :). And I'm actually very happy that I was able to finish the book, and could understand it until the end. And today, I didn't eat until I was three :). But I did have gum.

As long as it works for her, there shouldn't be any problems. I think it's about the simultaneous way of the two actions.

I feel like I haven't learned much over the summer - that's not really life though (I think I can use the subjunctive tense here, but it's not necessary).

I have to go to school tomorrow, and I think it will help me enjoy the day and the sun. I've been at home not enjoying the weather, and I want to see more birds! Is this too much to ask? My fingers hurt, so I'll stop writing, but I want to find new ways to learn and practice my Spanish. I also have my call with dr miao, and I don't want to do it, but I have to!!!

    Entry: It's a bit hot here. For starters, I woke up feeling a bit dizzy, ate - I just got Komi in karuta haha ​​- rice and banana - it didn't taste good, and watched a few episodes of korra. It's quite interesting and intense, but I think I prefer avatar the last airbender. I can't watch the simpsons :***( because there's a problem with disney+, and i signed out by accident. My brother got his electric guitar, and i want to buy a VR. Ugh I need to get on with my day. I played factorio for an hour, and the bugs - bugs apparently- bother me a lot! But now, I've solved the problem. I did yoga, and it was very relaxing and new - the class is more dynamic. Tomorrow I'm going to do some exercise, and I think I'll take more breaks between sets, because I'm going to need it. Hm, I wrote some code and discovered some bugs xd. I also watched some natural hypertrophy videos, and now, I want to write something but I don't know if my level of Spanish is high enough to write it. But I'll try. Or I forgot already! But, noNO now I remember. I finally figured out the meaning of - which came first, the chicken, or the egg. It seems to be a riddle because without the chicken, there wouldn't be an egg, and vice versa. Hmm, why is - haber - used to mean - to exist - in instead of - to be. Now I can't see the connection. Wait, I think I get it, when you use - to be - it's like - to be something, And I can't write what I'm thinking, but if I say - there wouldn't be an egg, and I replace it with if it would be - which is still incorrect, it should be if it were. I'll think about it a little bit more Now I get it and I think I should write it in English. When we use haber, its talking about something existing. Like hay azucar. It says that theres a presence, and that presence is sugar. But when we say es azucar. We already acknowledge the presence, and jsut take one more step in describing what it is. So when we want to talk about the presence or existence something and not its property, we use haber. Like deberia haber una solucion. There should be a solution. The presence of the solution is there, but we can't day deberia estar in solucion, because that implies that it's already there, and we are trying to identify it through its properties, which there is none

I just heard that my brother is taking a course at community college, which means he's going to be in class with me!! Hmm, I can't think about this too much, it's not going to change my life, and I won't lose any friends - my brain is kinda stupid, now I think if he makes friends with my friends- ethan and the others, or worse yet, andre says that I've introduced him ( andre ), without his knowledge, it's going to get really weird and awkward :*0. I'll leave those worries for me in the future. And it's weird but I don't want him to graduate early? Or it's not that I don't want him to, but from what I've heard, it seems like he doesn't have enough credits to do so. I don't know! And I'm not going to worry (actually, I'm not worrying, just thinking about the scenarios). It's his birthday and I ate Chinese food- it wasn't that tasty, but I can't complain. I wrote a lot of code today!! And it made me feel a bit overwhelmed, but I'm fine now. I just need to rest and take things slowly. I don't have to go to school tomorrow, and I think I'll spend the day writing code and watching simpsons or lillysinghvlogs xD. When I was working out, I felt like I was going to pass out, so I couldn't finish! But tomorrow, I'll do a basic workout. I also really want to buy a vr!! But, I know my parents won't support it, and really, I don't know and they haven't been involved in my decisions for a long time. Maybe I know I won't appreciate it or take advantage of its benefits.

I need to focus on designing the changes to my site with dr qian, and I need to apply the changes to other tests. I'm going to read the bible now. See you O and tomorrow is my brother's birthday. And now I want to read my past writings. Edit - when I was reading my past journals, I realized that I've changed a lot. There was this entry when I said that I didn't like learning vue, and I thought I was bored. Now, I'm excited to learn new things with vue. It's like a superpower. I can make or create whatever I want. When I learn new things, I feel like I've developed, intellectually and skill-wise - I can't find the word for it. I still love biology, and ecology, and animals - especially birds, I found out how parents feed children, and that they eat their poop (poop essentially) xD. I can't actually say definitively that I'm happier now because of "my" CS inclination, and I can't say if I would be happier if I had chosen ecology, but I know I like how I feel now, and I like creating new designs :)

Hansel hasn't been talking on the server :(, and it makes the server a bit boring, but I try to talk when I can. I started designing the registration page, and I don't like it very much, but I've sent it to the designer. I hope he'll give me some advice to improve the design. Hmm, my scar is healing, but my neck is still a bit tight. Now I'm off, and I like writing in Spanish. And I've discovered that I don't use spanishdict like before :), and now, I can write the things I want to say. I know I'll have to practice talking about other people, because now, I only practice the pronoun - yo, and sometimes el - like it. Edit I want to write about a topic that's bothering me a bit. Sometimes, many times, I think my older brother's intelligence is lower than mine. I don't know if I want to write in Spanish or not, but I'll try. Why do I feel this way? First, it seems like he's always trying to show the world what he's doing. A lack of humility for lack of a better word. That's right, he's trying to learn the guitar, and he tells Daniel about it, also with his job at Apple...and I think that's it, so. Hm, I think that's it. And I'm writing this because I want to rationalize his actions. First, with the guitar, I don't care that much, it's his decision, and I guess he has every right to talk about it with Daniel (and a little note, I'm not one to judge, so I'm writing it here so it doesn't bother me). With his job at Apple. He also has every right to talk about it with Daniel, well, because Daniel helped him, and he wants to know more. Other times he did things like, wait, I just remembered that he also shaved his wedges, and at first, I judged him because I thought he's like a sponge (I like that word xD, and the shadow of the wind is helping me with the vocabulary!!), but I realized that it's possible that he had done it, not for other people, but for himself, he can do whatever he wants with his body, and I can't say anything. Hmm.. and now, why do I think he's worse than me. And when I bring up this topic, it makes me ask for humility, and I don't like to feel that way, because it gives the impression that I only do the things I do to compare myself to other people, which is wrong - most of the time :(. And I do things like reading and practicing Spanish because I want to explore the world with an open mind. I also need to realize that this life is temporary, and I need to focus on eternal life. The more I read the literature, the more comfortable and happy I feel with that realization. Now I want to sleep because my fingers hurt, but it's a weight off my shoulders, and I can better understand that we both have different lives, and I should live my life without pity. I have one now that I want to get rid of.

    Entry: I'm feeling a little better, I'm looking at lillysinghvlogs and it's amazing as always. Neck is a little tight, but I think it's mental, and it's because I feel stressed :(. I just need to sleep. I figured out a way to fix the problem with linking users on the IAT site. I need to commit the changes, and I think I'll do that tomorrow. I also want to start with the quotes site. I haven't worked on it, and I haven't been learning typescript. Like nuxt.js, I'll start small, and when I want to find more features - features?, I'll use the documentation. Or and I need to finish the site design! I also need to listen to language transfer :*0, I only listen to it in the car, and it's something I want to change. Hmm, tomorrow is the weekend. I've been playing the game

    My mood awful
    
    Entry: Honestly I'm feeling pretty awful, lately I've been having moments of nostalgia, and along with that comes that yucky feeling in my chest, and I'm not writing in Spanish cause theres a lot I wanna say and I dont wanna think to muxh about things. So my brother was watching Johnny test and the feeling came again, so i did some meditation and stared out the window for a while lol...I'm trying to decipher what's up with this feeling, like a sense of dread, nostalgia accompanied dread. there are good moments of nostalgia, and they are usually tied in to my sense of smell, and those make me really happy. So my hypothesis right now is that memories without a smell attached to them give me the yucky feeling. I'm not really sure how exactly that works, and I doubt it's the case, but yeah  :(. ..Then there's the injury, I've been diving way too deep into this. First finding out that tetanus doesnt actually come from rust but actually dust, dung, etc. That didn't help much tho, also found out that I got vaccinated but then therea the voice that's like - the vaccine isnt 100 percent effective, or *the dust, which theres mostly just rust* is there. And there are like 30 cases of tetanus a year, mostly from people without the vaccine - which I have a bunch of - also me trying to rationalize my way out of this fear. Also I'm young and tetanus is more prevalent in older peeps or bebes. So the chance I get it is basically similar to the chance of me being struck by lightning. Also the back of my head is pretty tight slash tense. So it's making my mind go places, even though it has nothing to do with tetanus as the incubation period is 10 days or more. I guess knowledge is power but it's also pretty terrifying ..At least i learned some new info. But the more I see the bandage on my arm, the more I'm like *it could be something serious*, my head even went to cancer, geez! Even sounds ridiculous as I'm typing it. I I that when reading this in the future, I'd look at myself as dumb, but therea still the nagging voice that's like *what If you're right*, and it frustrates me, and I'm trying to think of the verse about worrying and adding an hour to your life, and it helps for a short while...There are sparks of joy like making lentils after a while, and watching persona with the sky server - I missed kenichi too :( . Que sera sera I guess ..( also just realized I smile when I'm nervous, but not nervous did something bad, like self soothing nervous )...2022 December Ara Edit ..LOlllll, looking back, yeah it all does sound pretty stupid, but future future me ,if you're reading this, dont discount your feelings based on what you think others or future yoj might think, calm down and think rationally!

    Entry: I hurt my arm - and because of that, I found a picture of myself as a child!! I forgot I had that picture and I made cookies but they didn't have a good texture :( I hope the wound isn't serious. I found out that I had my tetanus immunization three years ago, and it seems that I can't get tetanus from rust, but from dirty places, or contaminated places. I feel a bit silly :(. Very silly, but that's the past, and what happens, happens. OO and something good happened today, and something a bit bad, I'll start with the bad, I decided to redo my budget site! Why, you ask. Well, it's getting very complex, but not because it's difficult, but because I didn't have a plan, and now the design doesn't appeal to me, it's a bit banal :*). But, the good thing, someone has helped me design a new design, and it's very beautiful. I wanted to design something like that, but I don't know, now I'm going to have a plan, and I'm using typescript because why not, it's going to put me out of my comfort zone. And it seems that it's very interesting and useful. I'm a bit excited, but I'll have to start over, and that's not a fun thing to do. I also watched persona 3 - I think - or persona 4 with polly and nyny on the sky server. We're going to do it again tomorrow! And it was a lot of fun. I'm going to finish the new site design tomorrow, but I know I need to pay more attention to dr qian's work. I think the site is pretty much finished, but I want to refine it.

I cook spaghetti with chicken and carrots and cabbage. Hey, I went to udm, and I wrote code for IRBT - gender and toy. Now I want to sleep, and I don't feel like writing much, because I think my Spanish is failing me :*) And I was able to finish duolingo - or at least, level one. I did yoga but I didn't meditate today. Oh I need to do it!!! Get your act together me!

I want it to be a very clean and efficient project. My training was good. All in all - today was a bit of an interesting day, but mostly normal. And I want this guy's body xd

    Entry: A bit boring, I tried to get the final achievement on Sunday, but I couldn't do it because a question confused me ;-;. I know that if I do it again, I might get it - I don't know why we don't use the subjunctive tense in the past. Either it's not necessary, or because the sentence is not in the subjunctive tense, we shouldn't use it. I don't know, I still need to practice. Eh, last night, it took me quite a while to sleep, I felt a bit bored at night, and I think I know how to solve my doubt with the budgeting site, and now I just need to write the code to do it. It shouldn't be hard. But now I want to sleep, oh I have to brush my teeth. And I feel happy with my body. I don't think it has changed that much, but it's great, and it makes me feel safe, and my body is getting used to my plan. I need to stick to it!! And today, I learned that peregrinación means - pilgrimage , because apparently, peregrino means - from far away- or something like that OH And I found out that Michael was going to the MEZ with me! How strong, right? And it smells really weird in here, in fact, it smells awful, but I can't do anything, and I think it's because of the rats - I just found out that when I want to say - it is because of ..., I don't use porque, but debera a - due to

    Entry: I don't really feel like typing in spanish, but I'm going to do it. Now I tried to change the code and logic of the site. I think I did it pretty well, but, I don't know, it doesn't make me as happy as before. I think it's because I already knew how to do it, and it's not a big barrier. I think I'll read more of the wind's shadow. In the sky chat, they didn't post an update, but all good. Now, I want to focus my posts on my emotions, and less on what happened in the day. I felt a little sentimental, I wasn't sad, but I wasn't happy. I wrote a lot of lines of codes, and now, I feel a little "overcast". I should relax during this break :(. I haven't really had the chance to get bored, but that could be a good thing. I just discovered that when we want to say - "where" but in a context that means - "in which", we have to use - "en que" or "en el que". Like the house I was born in.

    Entry: I made cookies!! And they tasted great. Mom told me they tasted really good :D. I also had my call with dr qian, and I have changes to make, but they're not too hard >"D. The bad thing is that I think I'll have to postpone my secondary project - I almost formed that sentence without the dictionary :(, but I know my Spanish is improving, And I was on a call with prof dele.es, and we played kahoot. I was winning, but I made mistakes and ended up in 7th place :(. But I learned that a fontanero is a plumber. And English is a Germanic language - compared to Spanish, Portuguese, and French, which are Latin languages. I haven't listened to many transfer language lessons in Italian, and I want to, but I don't know, I procrastinate a lot :(. Buuuut, natural hypertrophy has a series called - the educated barbarian - and it talks a lot about topics like philosophy, morality, right and wrong, stuff like that. I did yoga, and I don't eat as much as I used to, but I want to eat less. I don't know if I should use - se -. I never seem to use it, but, I guess I just I'm talking to myself. Eee there's not much to write, I still need to increase my vocabulary, and it turns out that it's - to be - a little bit harder - than I thought -. I guess when I use turns out, it's like - it turns out to be, and because of that, I have to use - turns out to be, and from what i is - from what i

    Entry: Now I feel great. Now, knowledge excites me!! I don't know, but I love the feeling of knowing something new, and being able to share it with other people!! Today, I saw Dr. Qian for the first time, and she talked about "microexpressions", and I understood it because as you know, I've seen videos and articles about it. She also mentioned Paul Eckman, who (of whom), I've heard of before. And I also want to know about new cultures and the practices of unknown countries! I also want to travel. :( and trying new foods. But, changing the subject/in other news, I'm still reading the shadow of the wind, and I downloaded don quixote to read! After i finished - after i finish - this book, of course. I'm learning new words, and changing the subject again, joy sent me an email, saying that udm didn't have my documents, I don't know. My dad is going to call her tomorrow, and I hope I can work for her - I think for es - on ... behalf -. I hope she can pay me, I don't know, now I just use my money to buy books :(. OH OH I just remembered something. My uber driver spoke in Spanish!! But I couldn't understand him because it was so loud, and he had a really weird accent. Oh I don't want the feeling of stress that comes with UDM and their bureaucracy- the visa thing :(. I hope that it can get resolved quickly - i hope that it can get resolved (resolvse) quickly ). BUT , but, I survived when it happened, and I can survive now, and I'm kinda used to dealing with bureaucracy ( dealings - deals ). Joy knows what she's doing, and I should trust her. Tomorrow, I don't have much to do. I think I'll clean up the site for dr. Qian, and see what I can change to make the site better. I also played sky with Rona, lama and nyny :), and Loule, but loule doesn't talk much anymore. :(

I'm trying to improve my vocabulary, I read the bible in spanish now, and spanishdict has a vocabulary test. I have to go to udm tomorrow!! Dr. Miao has a lab for students to do her research, and I'm a little scared of it, I'm not feeling too overwhelmed or worried, but I'm not really happy with the state of the site right now.

    Entry: Ayy today was a total waste, at the beginning, I woke up very early - at six, and saw my dad without clothes ;-;. It still seems like a dream to me. Then, I took a shower, and got ready to go to the place where I stayed for more than 12 hours!! We arrived at seven thirty, and they didn't start until maybe twelve. Then, they almost fought, and there was a lot of shouting. But therefore, I restarted a book in Spanish - La sombra del viento. It's a rather long book - not as long as tcomc. I stopped reading superfunctionsl training because now, it doesn't help me much, it only talks about things like kettlebell and sandbag training. La sombra del viento is - at least I think it is - very advanced, but I can understand what the chapters mean - the main point. I want to finish the book, and I will! There are complex vocabularies in all the tenses, and sometimes there are paragraphs that I can't read :(. But, but I know that I just need to get the main point, and I have found that I need to practice my speaking a lot because when I practice in my head, sometimes it takes me a long time to think of the sentence I need to say. - to myself Or and I started an animated movie called - your name. It's pretty good. I think my Spanish has improved? I think so! But it can be small changes that add up and result in a bigger and noticeable change. I also started the Italian course from language transfer. OH OH and I saw opemipo - the one from the church - and Julian - from robotics

I don't know where it would be, and I don't feel like finding out, I just described something. I can use - while - to say - as long as - combined with the subjunctive tense. For example, as long as I have - we don't use that, I don't know why - my phone and my kindle, it would be fine. Ahh I think it's the same as "when... in the subjunctive to refer to an action in the future. So when I use while, I can use the subjunctive tense to mean a subjunctive action, but with a hint of the future. And as long as I have my language transfer videos - I've downloaded the lessons for my Italian language, I should be entertained O o! and I almost fell asleep when I meditated. I can do 41 pushups now, but sometimes I need to rest in the middle of a set. I finished the first season of noragami. I don't love it as sk8, but it's pretty good.

And I don't really feel like restarting my learning of it. Sometimes, it's really boring, and it's rare that I'll use it in my work. O!! I almost forgot, I gave a lot of people some of my karuta cards!! And some people asked me if it was okay, and it made me feel a little weird. Tomorrow, I'll find something to cook, and I hope it'll be really good.

    Entry: I want to sleep but I think today was a good day. I finished the conté de monte cristo!!! And I watched the movie!! Which was fine, but I much prefer the book, I think the movie couldn’t capture the essence and purpose of the book, and I started reading superfunctional training. I decided to reduce the amount of pull-ups to 30 pull-ups, because in reality, it’s really hard to do, and it makes me feel like I’m going to pass out. Lately, I don’t play Sky much, and it makes me feel bad because there’s nothing to look forward to, and I just want them to do something great, like on prank days. Hmm what else, it’s a little hot here, and I don’t feel as uncomfortable with the heat as before, but I think that’s just because summer hasn’t really started. I want to lose a little body weight, but I don’t know. I don’t feel like tracking my calories, and I want to get stronger, because I haven’t reached my challenge of 30 pull-ups, 100 push-ups, and 150 square yet. BUT, today, I did 40 pushups in one set, that's my max, and it made me feel happy. Ayy enough about me, I've been chatting with ben, and he tells me that he's started his job. Andre has to sign a lot of paperwork, and dr miao sent me an email, saying that I should include my free time, because his lab is in person. I should email him and ask if I need to go in person, because we have our meetings online. I didn't meditate today, but I know I should. I've been practicing my scorpion pose, which has been really fun. I also don't feel as overwhelmed with my Spanish as I used to.

I did yoga and meditated after the session. I'm almost done with the monte cristo conté, and a lot of things happened in these chapters!! First, Dantés almost died, because I found out that Mercedes always knew he was Dantés. Because of that, she decided not to kill Albert, but nobody died. Then, everyone found out that Andrea was a criminal!! And Fernand died!! By suicide after finding out that the conté was Dantés! Villefort's wife was trying to kill Valentina, and now, it seems that she did it, but I don't want to believe it, and I think the conté did something so that Valentin wouldn't be killed. Danglars' daughter left with her instructor. I know I'm forgetting something, but yes!! A lot of things, and I think I'll finish the book tomorrow. :D. And then I can start with the bioneer book - super functional training. Actually, I want to read a book in Spanish, but now there are other books in English that I want to read. Wish me luck!! I want to read the Bible, and then, I will go to sleep. I hope that tomorrow, my dad goes to work, because I love being alone :). And! I found out that in vue, if I use - v-if - I can make components not load, and because of that, I can combine it with promises - which I now understand more clearly than before.

Today was a pretty interesting day, actually, I mean I feel rad, because me and my younger brother and dad went to take passport photos, we need to go to different places to find a place to do it, but it was so much fun. I remembered the sky wars game on roblox!!! I can't believe I forgot!!! And I was happy to play it. Ayy I forgot to read the Bible!! I'm going to do it now. I think I'll just do one chapter because it's so late. I sent a message to ben, I want to chat with him because I haven't been able to talk to him and I want to see how he is. Now I'm going to read the Bible and go to sleep. ayy I also forgot to meditate!!! :(

And when I get there, there will only be (at the beginning, I used -to miss- but that means -to miss- and I mean -to remain-, so, I had to change it) ten lessons left. I finished sk8, and it's a really good anime, I relate a lot to reki, like, the similarities are uncanny. I'm listening to language trandfer now.

Tomorrow I have scp and I need to go to margrove campus. I don't have any strong feelings against it, but I'd like to not do it. I want to read the bible, and then, I'll go to sleep. Oops oops H I started a new anime called Sk8. It's really interesting and I actually relate to the MC, well, both mcs, but in one field, there's the support character, who introduces his friend - the other MC - how to skate, and he finds out that he's better than him. Sometimes I feel like that, when I see someone who is more talented, but other times, I know that for others, I am that guy, the one who can pick up new things easily, but when I am in the position of the support character, it makes me feel bad, and like I am not doing all that I can do, and you know how I react :(. Well now, I feel tired, I am done moral orel and I enjoyed it a lot. Recently, I have found that when I do something, I always put it in the context of "how can I tell others that I have done this". I don't know how to say it, it's like I do something because I know that it will be useful when I talk to other people. And I worked out today and it was so brutal!! Like, I felt like I was going to pass out. Now I am going to sleep

I also really like meditation!! It makes me feel very relaxed and less stressed. Today, I watched some videos on the vue course, and I also learned about promises on vue. The topic is not very clear to me, but I know that I just need to practice it, and when I need to use it, there are many resources to learn, and now, I already know everything I need to know- or at least, I understand it enough. I followed my dad to get food and in language transfer, we are learning about the subjunctive tense, I am going to restart the lesson at lesson 70 because I want to make sure I understand everything. I have a B in calculus ;-;. I didn't do much work on the budgeting site, but I am not going to rush it. Tomorrow I do yoga and I can't wait.

So I'll continue, and if I don't want to write in spanish, I'll allow myself to write in English, but, I know it will take time, and I think I'm ready for this challenge. I will not fail!! OH and!! I just found out about this show? it's called moral orel, and it's really weird but it's pretty interesting!! I played genshin and a little bit of sky, but the others on the sky server don't play sky like before. It's me, lama, and sometimes the others. When I look outside (I need to trust myself more), I still feel like I told you in the last post, like a longing to escape and FLY, but not as extreme, but yeah!! I feel like that, and I have my devices and computer and when I look at it, it makes me feel like I do nothing with my life!!! I just watch YouTube and play roblox. But actually, I do a lot more than those two. I'm making the tax site, and as a consequence, I'm learning new technologies like nuxt.js! I use it to learn Spanish! To have fun and relax when I feel down - like now xD, and with these devices, I can learn even more new things. I just need to find a balance between using my devices and not using them. I'm also going to start reading during the weekends. I don't do it but I should start!! And I already see that sometimes, writing in Spanish is hard, but other times like now, I can do it with - and I'm afraid to say it - ease. I'll have my ups and downs, but I shouldn't let them stop me - subjunctive.

    Entry: He estado sintiendo un poco triste, pero más de FOMO. Uso demasiado mi teléfono, y no, lo siento pero necesito escribir en ingles. I feel like I've been feeling, not sad, not overcast, but lost? And just wandering. Stuck in a hole essentially. Like I'd look outside and when I decide to pay attention to my senses, i feel much happier. I dont know if this is a an effect of stopping yoga? But I am going to start the O.N.E program from the bioneer, so 100 pushups, 50 pullups- I'll do maybe 5 rounds of 10 pullups and maybe negatives, and 150 air squats. It is very minimalistic but I'm combining it with cardio, yoga and meditation.  I really feel like im stuck in a hole, and I probably will for most of the summer since I'll not really be going out and will just spend most of my time on my phone/laptop. Of course my goals for the summer require my phone and laptop, but that might be another problem. I would so love to experience new things, and I feel ungrateful but at the same time I recognize that my baselines have shifted from myself in the past, and the amount of happiness I receive from things. I've spent over 7 hours on my phone, and will work on reducing the screen time.  So lately this hasnt been a good week, I csnt go to the gym, but luckily I already have a plan, I feel overwhelmed with my Spanish learning, and I need to slow down, and I think writing here in Spanish does contribute to that overwhelming feeling. On a positive note, I found this show called moral orel..  I would say I'm in a rut right now, and I'll find my way out of it, just got to process some things

    Entry: I had my calculus test and I don't think I did well, but I don't care that much. I still feel a little overwhelmed, but it's better than before. I just need to practice more. I guess I worry about the fact that it would take me a long time to learn Spanish, but it's not that bad - not all its cracked up to be - but I just figured something out! When I used that phrase, I didn't know the literal translation, I just wrote it down because I think I've heard it so many times that I know how to use it. I hope it stays that way. I don't feel tired and after this, I'll read the Bible because the challenge has begun. I played sky with nyny and jolin and I got Mona and (another person whose name I've forgotten)

    Entry: Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed. But first, I'll start with the good ones. I watched "bubbles"!!! The movie and it was amazing, the animation was amazing!! And the story, chefs kiss. Today was leg day, and I did squats. It wasn't a good session, but it's manageable. I ate too many cookies, but I don't feel guilty. Now for the bad ones, I still think my Spanish isn't improving, and it's the opposite. I was working with the quoting site, and I was going too fast. Because of that, there were a lot of errors and there are still things I don't understand - like the security rules in firebase. I don't know how it works, and it seems like there isn't a good - buen is good and bien is well- site to learn it. I have my calculus exam tomorrow, and I don't think I studied enough. I just got my grades for the programming exam, and I did great! I'm happy about that, but I don't feel as confident with the calculus exam as I did with the programming one. There are so many things I want to learn, and I think I just need to breathe, inhale and exhale. Sometimes I think that when I write in Spanish, it only serves to increase my stress, but it is something I want to do and continue because it means I can follow my resolutions. Actually, yes! I think I just need to breathe, and appreciate everything I have learned - because I know I have surpassed my past levels, and I can only keep going!! I will take things one step at a time and find my way. We will survive!! And I will go slower from now on.

    Entry: I still feel overwhelmed, I have to learn the imperative tense, and there are more confusing words :(. I always have to remember that it will take a long time and I need to get used to that. I have my ups and my downs - apparently, there is a word I can use for this - ups and downs, like a mix of high and low, ups and downs. And these past few days, I've been down :(. Nobody is perfect, and I've struggled with these senses, and I've overcome them, and I can do it now, I don't need to go to school tomorrow!! So I can sleep a little later, but I think, no, I don't want to believe, I'm just going to do it. If I don't understand something, I'll learn it, and if I can't learn it, Fidlee dee, I have to realize that Spanish is not my life, and although I want to be able to speak fluently, I'll need to deal with days like this, and I can learn new words and practice new concepts, like ups and downs - it's a great word. I have my calculus test on Saturday but I don't feel like studying, and I know that I need to study!! I will do it tomorrow, I promise. I think I will review the textbook, and do more problems. Plus, I am trying to immerse myself in the culture of Spanish-speaking countries. They are very interesting. Well, on another topic, I worked out this morning, and my biceps were toned! The pump xD, I think now I will read the book and go to sleep.

    Entry: I've learned something else, when the last letter in a word is N, S, or a vowel - vowel-, we need to put emphasis on the second to last syllable, for example, syllable xD. The last letter is a vowel, but it's not said like syLLaB- an emphasis on the second to last syllable. So when a word doesn't follow the rules, we would need to put an accent,

    Entry: I had a break of over 7 hours, and I enjoyed it a lot. I read the mont cristo story, and found out that Villefort and Mme Danglars had a baby, and maybe she realized that Dante was lying to her. I need to remember that realize is a reflexive verb. Now I want to sleep, I have a final for programmatic tomorrow, and I need to study. I also need to study for calculus. I'm still working on the budgeting site. I played sky with Nyny and it was so much fun!! We did a play with some foreigners :D AY Edit I almost forgot. As you know, I handed in my leadership portfolio with a picture of Homer and Lisa. I didn't expect him to read it, but he read my essays and at the beginning of class, he told me I did a great job. He also told me he didn't know about my age. Then, when we were sitting in a circle, I said I was happy to meet everyone, and I mentioned amine and elise. I hope I got it right, but then, Mr. Don told everyone that he was forty years old. I corrected him, and everyone looked shocked! Even Steven guy, the one I couldn’t talk to the whole semester, and I’ve seen him many times at the gym, had a shocked face xD and I don’t know, it makes me feel like he’s been paying attention to me, or something. I don’t know, I’ve never talked to him!!!! Now I’m going to sleep, also today, I feel uncomfortable with my Spanish, and it makes me feel like I’m not developing, but I know that when I do this, I learn more and more every day. And I don’t care if I make mistakes because I can always fix them in the future, and it’s better than doing nothing!

    Entry: I've already submitted my leadership portfolio, and added a picture of Homer xD. It's the last week, and I've finished my history class. Today I realized that André has a lot of things to do and my previous journals have been very rude, I don't know :(. What else to say, I played roblox with Hansel today!! And it was really fun. I talked to someone - a little - in Spanish, and I was basically his translator. I still use language transfer, but sometimes it makes me feel overwhelmed - ayy I remembered the word- I started with the budget project!! I know I know, it's too early, but it's never too early. Nuxt js is pretty good and I'm glad I found it - this sentence is a mistake. Since - since - glad is not in its infinitive state, I can't use the conjugated state of haber. I have to say - I'm so glad I found it. And when I use me allegro, I need to add the "de" so I'm so glad I did it with you. But I just found out that it's me glad- it makes me happy, so when I think about the like, it's - it makes me happy. In actually, i don't know, and i don't feel like thinking in spanish.. i don't feel sad, but a little bad, when i try to speak in spanish and i make a lot of mistakes, it makes me feel bad ;-;, or at least, it makes me feel like i will never learn this language :/. you know how i feel, but i need to learn and realize that making mistakes is the only way to learn, and if i don't make mistakes, i will never challenge myself - desefia means challenge. buuuut, if i take it one step at a time, i will find my way. OH And, it's good to realize that i couldn't write like this in the past. i always needed to write words in english. i'm not perfect, but i will learn and i keep learning.

How amazing and easy, there are other amazing features too, like I can also use it with SSR - if I want to learn it, and it's easier to setup seo!! And that's not the best part, I can create a component, and I don't have to link it in the parent file. I can use components with ease!! I'm going to use it with my budgeting project. I'm studying calculus now, and I think I'm ready for the exam. I don't know if I want to go to tdr, because, I feel very comfortable here. NUXT js is great, and I can't wait to use it. Maybe I can combine it with TS when I get the chance

I don't know if I did it right. But it's good enough to hand in and at least I can get some points for the final exam. I found out that we can use the position function to find the displacement - displacement - and the distance is the absolute value of the displacement. Also that I can use the integral to find the position function with the velocity function. I got casca in karuta.

    Entry: It's pretty hot tonight, but I think it's very reminiscent. The smell reminds me of summer, and it makes me feel happy. We got the new car and it's wonderful!! I didn't do much work today, and my food wasn't very healthy, but today was a great day. I talked to Gilbert and Rick. And I decided to learn golang in the summer. First I'll watch the remaining videos in the vue course, then I'll buy a course on golang. When I finish it - and I already see that when I use something like when, or if in the past, we've talked about a subjective topic, and so, we used the subjunctive tense - then, when I finish it, I'll start with the budget site, and I'll use golang to make the database for the user information. I hope it works. The thing about the project is that I don't know how long it would take me. I have four months left, and if it takes me two months to finish the vue course, I'll have two months left. I've found a golang course that only has nine hours of content. I can use that, or I can use one with forty hours of videos. Actually, if I want to do something good, I would have to dedicate a lot of my time on it. So, I will do the forty hour course. And when I finish it, I can ask Daniel to help me make a database with golang, and I guess I will find a way to link the data with the vue one. I think when I finish the golang course, THAT IS MY PLAN with that, I will work with journi, and if I can, I will work with mister hill, and if he pays me, great. I just hope I can finish the two courses and start with the budgeting site. At least if I can’t complete the budgeting site, I can always work on it during the semester. I hope I can finish my work with madam miao so I can work on my own. Alas, good night. Plan Finish the vue course Start and finish the golang course Read some books Rest!!!! Enjoy the summer Start other projects, now you can work with vite and golang!

Amazon has delivered my calculator, and I'll learn how to use it before the calculus exam. I'm going to sleep now.

    Entry: Good morning, I slept quite early last night, and now I feel great. It's been a long time since I've written so early here. I'm writing here because I've learned - or rather, when I was sleeping, my brain figured out that when we say something in the past, but in the conditional tense, we use the subjective tense with the imperfect tense. For example, if i was an animal, We can see that there is a conditional tense, If i was. We can also see that it is in the past, i was. The same applies to - the same thing applies itself to - sentences like if i could see her one more time. If i could is in the conditional tense and the scene is in the past - could, not can. So, it will be if I could see her one more time. I want to compare this to the conditional tense in the present, so when we say something like i would do it when i have the time - lo diría cuando tengo el tiempo, we can see that it is the conditional in the future. Actually, I think I understand it, but I don't really know why we use the subjunctive in the past tense with the conditional tense. Maybe it's because you can't say for sure ( for sure, and use se wheneevr you aren't speaking in 1st person. It may be doubt in WEIRDO. Wait! It's not in the conditional tense, it's in the past tense! Like if i could do it, it's not in the conditional tense, it's in the past, but it has a hint of uncertainty. Anyway, I think if means the subjunctive tense, because it's talking about an unknown topic. And when we use - if i was, or if i could be -, we need to use the imperfect tense I still need to learn MORE To say - the thing about -, like - the interesting thing is - lo interesante es. We can use lo de la fiesta or hablamos sobre lo de la fiesta - we speak about the thing about the party

    Entry: You know what? Today was an amazing day! I'm writing here because I want to use this place as a place to write notes from my Spanish learning. Now I've learned that I can use - lo ___, like the ___ thing. An example is - the interesting thing is that they are still together. Or the funny thing is that he has never called me, but he always wants me to call him. But generally, today has been a really good day. At seed, we went to the art institute in Detroit. I've never been there but it was really interesting. We got to school at three to thirty - 3:57. I had rescheduled my meeting with dr miao. The funny and amazing thing is that she cancelled the meeting because she had a conference? Or something like that. So I wrote down my changes, and I guess I would wait until she sends me the changes back. I had some free time, so I decided to go to destress fest. At first, there were so many people, and as you know, I was overwhelmed, but I saw Linu and her sister - the one who is in my history class, wow I have learned a lot about language transfer. Especially the thinking method. But, she told me about slime - yes! There was slime - I just learned that slime in Spanish is baba xD. But yes! I made two green slimes, but only one turned out well - turn out can mean to turn out, like to turn out well. I made an announcement on the duck, and Michael and Caleb came, I talked to him about tcomc and food and other things xD. I dared - what I don't understand is why that means i dared him, but, I dared to take a picture with Tommy - the mascot - but he didn't xD Now I'm home, I think I'll try to finish the calculus project. Wish me luck

    Entry: Now I feel pretty good, I’m not as overwhelmed as before, but there’s still a part of me that’s not happy with what happened. Now, I’ve finished the consent form, there’s validation, and I just need to add it to the individuation test. Sometimes, I feel like I don’t know what I just did. And another difference between I feel and I feel, now I need to use I feel that, which should mean I feel that, and I think I use it because I’m not talking about a feeling, like I feel bad or I feel happy, but when I use I feel that, it’s more of a statement than a feeling. So from now on, when I want to talk about something that isn't a feeling, I would use I feel like BUT that's not the point, I feel like I don't know what I'm doing, when I code something, I usually think about what I just did, and a part of me is always saying- "oh, you don't know what you just did. But I know I can do it a thousand times and even though I won't remember them all, and I always try to silence that voice - now I wanted to use I always try, but I think it's easier to use try, because I can know that silence will be in its infinitive status. I've struggled with this feeling, but you have to know that I can always learn what I don't know, and I shouldn't underestimate my knowledge. That said, how can I apply all of these in my life - on an untold note, my mother made a scavenger hunt! And finally! Kamila from Journi emailed me, and told me that I could work with journi this summer. So, when I feel like this, I can know that I'm not alone, if there's no one in the world who has I don't know how much this helps my Spanish, but, I think I just have to get used to it, and if I continue, I can develop new vocabulary- like overwhelmed- overwhelmed, omg bruma means mist, so when I say overwhelmed, it's like saying - I'm in a haze, like overcast, but overwhelmed. SO COOL. Like I was saying, this isn't going to make my Spanish worse or hurt, but it's going to help me see my mistakes and fix them, develop more confidence in speaking like that, and maybe I can speak fluently when I play roblox in Spanish xD. Actually, I have a lot to do, with dr miao, and study, but I can do them, and I know very well that when summer comes, I'll be bored out of my mind, and I hope I have, or I hope I have a lot to do - but not so much as to get overwhelmed (but not so muxh as to). I also need to start my streak of resisting temptation

    Entry: Right now, I feel bad, or rather, I feel overwhelmed. Very overwhelmed with javascript. It all started with me trying to get user data into the form, but there was an error. Then, I searched for a solution on the internet, and I found something with array.reduce. As you know, I don't know how to use array.reduce, so the solution worked, but I didn't understand why. Since then - from then on. - I started reading MDN about array.reduce, and then, I realized that I haven't used vanilla js for a long time. So I kept reading. The more I read, the more I realized that my js knowledge is not as good as I thought. I don't know how to use promises, or array functions. And it made me feel overwhelmed. And I don't want to write in English because I know that this is important and it's helping me a lot to improve my Spanish. But, I've felt like that many times in the past, and I've overcome them. If I don't know something, I can learn it, as always. I have to realize that I have developed websites many times, and I can do more, I work with Dr Miao and I am helping her make a website for her studies. That is impressive. I will never know everything. I AM SIXTEEN!! For God's sake, I don't need to do interviews or anything like that. But now I need to go, I just saw Aaron

Oh oh, and there are only two days left, or two and a half days because I have my call with Dr miao at four. It snowed all afternoon- and I use snowed because it's a specific period? And I don't use was...because I don't know?!! It seems there's no definitive guide for this. It might be one of those things that can give away that I'm a gringo ;-;. I just need more practice.

I don't feel like, another mistake, I should say that- I don't feel like writing anymore, and I should only use - I don't feel, in a basic sentence, or when I talk about my feelings - I don't feel happy, and I should use I don't feel like, when I want to say something I don't want to do! I finally reached (how to advance or ive reached this point) level 16 in genshin and I could play with the others, actually, I don't like the game, and I think sky is much better and more relaxing, and I love sky's graphics, compared to genshin.

    Entry: There is a certain part of me that doesn't like Andre. It's a small part, but sometimes, it decides to grow and make me feel angry, or uncertain?? I don't know Ben got his puppy today! And I helped him with his code. Andre told me he made some functions, but when I or Ben tried them, they didn't work! It's like, he told me he couldn't run the code, but I think it's because he doesn't want to, or he doesn't try to see why vsc doesn't work. I try to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I usually listen to my intuition, and when things like this happen, I can't let my intuition go, and my intuition tells me that either he's not doing his best and he's a lazy bastard, which unfortunately I think is the case, or he's in trouble. I don't know! A lot of times, I just need a good night's sleep, but other times like now, it makes me angry. Why does it make me angry? Why doesn't he know how to use his free time? Or it's because I can't stop looking at his smiling face. And actually, I think a lot of times, they are lies, so are his jokes. I don't know! It's like he's always looking for attention, and because of that, he says absurd things. But that's another thing, now Ben tells me that Andre has already gone to bed. Oh God forgive me, I'm nobody to judge, it's his life! And this doesn't affect him and I need to shut up and focus on my life. What's in my life, I can do 5 pullups! I did one of the essays for the leadership class portfolio...I also helped Caleb with his problems. I was listening to Jesca Hoopp, and I think I already know the difference between I was listening and I was listening, I was listening is like - I used to listen or I listened as a repeated action in the past. We use the imperfect tense, we also use the past tense when I say I was listening, but that can mean that in the past, or my state in the past was described when listening to something. Now I'm going to sleep. Finally, I should add more emotions, and get rid of the ones I don't need.

They were pretty good, so I helped Ben and André with their project. I don't think they can finish it tomorrow, but I already know I'll need to help them a lot. Hmm, I made some changes with my work, I haven't been very productive - and I know I should use been - be - because productive is like sincere or honest, in my opinion, it's not a statue, but a characteristic of being, a human trait. I'm halfway through the monte Cristo story. The last chapter was very philosophical, I don't know why was is used here, but maybe it's not a description, but an account of the book? I don't know man, I can just practice my Spanish here. Another advantage of writing is that now I can go slower when I write. Other than that, I'm watching deleted scenes in the simpsons. I don't have much to do tomorrow but I don't feel like going to coding club tomorrow My brother bought a pullup bar, I don't know, I felt like telling you

I was trying to play rocket league but it didn't work out. I still have to make some changes for irbt. And I think there's a difference between some and ones. When I want to say something like - I don't know if there's a way, I think the proper translation is I don't know if there's any way. When I try to think of the difference, I just come up with some or ones are about numbered things - but some is more of an abstract thing. Something ones? Plus, today was the last day of seed counseling and it makes me feel sad because I can't talk to others on a regular schedule now, but what can I do. OH I talked to Raine! And I introduced her - introduces - to lama!! We talked for a while, and I also talked to Sean. He told me about his food problems. It makes me feel weird and sad because I can't imagine always having body aches, and I hope he feels better.

    Entry: I was helping my dad with his work for a while. Oh I need to find someone I can practice my Spanish with. Oh my plan is working, with the sentence above, I wanted to know what the difference was between con que and con quien. Then I realized that in English, it's with who, not with that. And I was right. But I still need a lot of help with the past tense. In language transfer, I learned how to use "se", but I don't use it often. I also learned that the preterite tense is like a dot in the past, and the imperfective tense is like a line. I was trying to use that tip, but I don't think it works, at least not now. I'll get it, if not now, then in the future. Leadership class went pretty well. I kept smelling something weird, and I don't think it smelled bad, but :( Mm I have a calculus test tomorrow on antiderivitive and u substitution. I'm going to practice it in the library tomorrow, as usual. Oh and I rode my bike today, cardio yay. I think from now on, I'll guess which tense to use, but I can also use my background knowledge to know when I should use the preterite tense and the imperfect tense. I'm going to sleep now, ciao

    Entry: Today I learned something new, you should use afuera when you talk about the position of something or someone, but you should use el exterior when you talk about outside outside. With that being said, I watched a lot of spanish after hours videos, I still love it, in language transfer, we talk about the conditional tense. I think the conté de monte Cristo is Edward Dantés but I don’t know!! No, it’s him, there are too many clues and actually, it should be obvious. I still get annoyed by the past tense in Spanish. Aaaand I just found out that tense in Spanish is time, and tense, like being uncomfortable or annoying, is tense! How cool ;-;. I think, no, I know I can read and maybe listen well in Spanish, what I need help with is writing and thinking in Spanish. Sometimes it’s easy, like now because I’m not talking about the past tense but the present. When things get tough. Like now - I needed to look up on spanishdict how to say that, AY I don't have my leadership class tomorrow, sometimes I like that class but recently I haven't been interested in it and I think it's a waste of time. Today I learned that phrase, recently, I like it. I think I'll start doing this. I'll write here, and when I'm not sure about something, I'll look it up on spanishdict. I also think I should use the English words with the Spanish words. Because when I say something like "I will do it", sometimes I want to use the conditional tense, when I should use the future tense. Omg I have my notes from my Spanish class!! I have to see my writing!

    Entry: I feel meh, nothing much to say. I still listen to language transfer and I'm on chapter 40 of tcomc. I think caleb was listening to the audiobook because this book is really long. I don't have much to do with my work but it took me more than two hours to do it. Tomorrow is my deadlift day and I want Ben to work out with me. I didn't eat much today because actually, I'm already bored of tdr food...at least sometimes. Now I'm brushing my teeth. The new season of sky started today!! I'm so glad and I love shared memories. I made one about how to fart in sky xD now I'm going to sleep

    Entry: To follow the tradition of writing in Spanish. Today I did nothing special. I brushed my teeth ;-;. I talked to the duck guys and we reorganized some channels. I want to talk about the preterite and imperfect tense. Both are the bane of my existence. It's just that, sometimes I think I've understood them, but noOoO, there are always exceptions or something that doesn't make sense/correspond with what I've learned. Sometimes it frustrates me a lot, but I need to remember that I have language transfer and I just need to wait until I reach the topic of the two tenses. Other than that, I played genshin impsct, I want to be able to play with the others on the sky server. Now I'm going to sleep. My fingers hurt too, but also, I finally read the remaining chapters, and now I can focus on the calculus project.

It's been a long time since I talked to them. I missed them. Now I think I'm going to sleep. Tomorrow shouldn't be so stressful, I hope my mom has to go to school. What's more, I think I understand better how to use the subjunctive tense, sometimes, I worry a lot about speaking Spanish, but I think I'm getting better. I still watch dororo, what an interesting anime! I want to finish it before my Amazon prime subscription expires. I'm going to sleep, bye.

    Entry: One of those days I havent had in a while. I guess overcast but not really. So the gist of it is that...idek, nope that's a lie, I know how it started, watching coding youtube videos, almost always happen! Then is started looking into node js vs python - decided to learn python.  However, decided that I'm gonna wait, I guess, but for javascript, specifically vue, I guess Daniel's goal transferred to me and now I wanna be really proficient in vue! Like actually proficient and knowledgeable. Granted I wouldnt know everything, but I'd know a lot to get me by! Surviving just fine off coding with dr miao, which, had our call today and I have a few changes to make...made basically all the changes she gave me from last time so GOOD JOB ME ,get a pat on the head boi, also finals week soon! Well, I'm sti studyingnfor calc and got to understand the newton's rule and the whats it called, sigma notation with integrals, which I guess isnt that bad but its not great,   Played table tennis with ben, and you are right, it was a fleeting fancy, however ehn. Must contact my dam mentor ! About the coding thing, building habits so I'll start pretty small every day, maybe when I get home. Gonna try to tie it in with another habit. Right now I'm listening to language transfer everytime I get into a car and its surprisingly effective. I usually journal whenever I have the urge to and almost always late at night, so I'll just take this slow and try to keep it high on my priorities. If school work gets in the way, I'll still try! But it would be more of an expendable thing which will still come later@!   Planning on working on the calc project tomorrow, the extra cred one, a lil bit overwhelmed tbh. I'm still keeping up with things pretty well though! :D. Except my budget app which also is kinda being put aside to focus on dr miaos work.  Kalisha sent an opportunity I believe I dont wanna do so I'm not going to fill up my plate! I'll let future me decide. Mlh, idk man...hmmm what else, reading berserk, pretty interesting.  Okay so plan!   For coding future  - get proficient at vue js, aka, finishing the updated course and finally learning about the composition api!!!!  - learn python, would be great to expand horizon   For school plan  -you already know   Random word, rmemeber when I wanted to get into Ecology :D. Also I dont know how much better I am getting at this overwhelmed thing...I think I'm doing pretty well, since I cant read minds...yet, can only compare to my past self, and I believe I usually got into deep rabbit holes and some sadness, but it's not as bad and I'm just focusing on deep breaths and letting the thoughts go by

    Entry: Honestly today was pretty amazing, had a weirddddd dream last night! With hansel and it was us LoL. I think I'll stay in the library more during mid day cause ben is usually there, hush. Anyways, I did cardio, and boy did I wear myself out. 10 miles - if its measure in miles IN 30 MINUTES, all with the help of music and wow I got into the zone@! Closed my eyes and just imagined myself zooming am I gonna try to beat that, probably the typical pace is like 45 mins to an hour...and considering I did it in like 15 mins less, just sheesh, maybe bicycling is right for me   It was also a good way to let off some steam, you know why, no point writing here. Anyways, geez I should be writing in dpanish but I dont want to take away from what I'm thinking. Leadership class was so AWKWARD towards the end. We did this crossing the line thing where we all stood up and in silence and he said some group that's usually discriminated against and just look at each other in silence.geez it was awkward, pretty eye opening though, interesting how that works   Also missed my mentor at the mentorship get together ugh! ANYWAYS, I felt soooooo drained after cardio, like you know that feeling, I remember having it after hiit, irs like my body shutting down! Anyways dont wanna drag this too long. Sky update, awesome constellation! New season sooon

I do have an issue with not wanting to appear fat or bloated:( I dont want to get fatter over the summer, something that I feel is happening now!!! With me, I guess not overeating on one occasion, but meals spread around! I feel my face being rounder, enough self hating, or more like self overanalyzing! Goodnight for now!    ALSO started talking with michael again!!!! Feels pretty nice, and raspberry oranges, or oranges in general are pretty amazing. I used to get turned off by the texture, but I guess tangerines fixed that! Alsonhavent developed overcast in a while, watch me jinx it xD

It's like, a buncha people drop pixels every 5 minutes and it's amazing and chaotic and the sky server - another one had one, with some other loona server which was pretty cool but it then got raided by this other server dude and they were all in this vc and it was so chaotic and lovely hahaha, it wa pretty annoying tho@!

Now I learned something new from my parents. Apparently, when my dad and mom got married, they would get a gift with ten Naira in it. And after that, dad couldn't get a job for many years. And I didn't know!! I thought he was a businessman or something, and I know I've admitted that I didn't know what he did, but I don't know! Now I can only think of how many sacrifices they have made - both my parents - for me. It's very humiliating. I also have a cough.

    Entry: Same love is stuck in my head! Woke up from a weird dream and I'm trying to associate more Spanish with my everyday life. I don't know, but I think I can now write in this Journal without worry, I don't know, I use that word too much. But, today was, and I use was because today is the present, well, it can also be the past, but the imperfect tense is for repeated actions or a description of a scene in the past. What's more, I finally saw some videos of the season performance and I don't know! I think it's going to be very different, but I can enjoy it with my friends from the server. The programming class was fun. From now on, I will write in Spanish, and now, I don't feel too worried or stressed about speaking Spanish. And THAT'S not all, I'd like to think I've developed a kind of intuition with, maybe prepositions. Ethan got rengoku in karuta!!

    Entry: Taking the coding for the gender iat a bit slow today, just cause I know that I can get it done prettt quickly. Actually feeling quite overwhelmed with studying for calc though! I fell out of the habit of studying before class and now i gots to start from 4.1 and catch up to where we are today, at least i know the basics, first derivative set to 0, finds the points in which the graph is increasing/decreasing local min and local max  Second derivative if greater than 0 is for concave up and concave down, I imagine you plug in the critical values if it stil lhas a variable in it and check to see! I'll have to go over the textbook  My throat feels weird! Like dry. Super dry. Discovered my lower back rounding during deadlift, not very cash money. Alsokaruta, got some gems as you might know and got the generosity blessing xD,  OH OH HIGHLIGHT OF THE DAY. as you know I'm getting deeper into espanyol and I talked to aaron in Spanish while we played chess! It felt so nice to apply what I was learning!!!! I wanna talk with more people in Spanish. hello TALK DUG

Anyways, my dilemma yesterday, COMPLETELY GONE. Doesnt bug me one bit. Anyways tho, leading cru tomorrow, also turned in calculus project and got my service hours signed. It has been a super productive day actually, even did some work on unity!@ the day went quite quickly so I didnt notice how much I did. Also lifted 185lbs on bench pess today woo! I realized I might be limiting myself extremely when it comes to my strength on it, and I'm going to try the flared ish elbows going up  ALSO PLANNING ON MINI CUTTING  also quick observation, I usually journal most about what's in a sense defining me, first it was lifting and robotics, then fasting and self esteem, now its college, sky to a point,and my job. Idk what to call it a lotta times, I just use miao XD. I also think shes going to be very impressed with my progress so far. I plan on finishing the race iats by next week! Also scp in person this week, woop woop?  Oh! Funny thing, will smith slapped chris rock XD, idk, its memed to death   AND DAYS OF BLOOM

    Entry: Generally today was good, went for the award ceremony thingy and got my thingy. Waste of time if you ask me but it was pretty nice.   I ALSO SOLVED THE BUG AND AM ABLE TO PROGRESS. NOW that makes me a happy camper XD  Anyways, what doesnt make me a happy camper, as you know and ugh why do i struggle with it so much, maybe cause I give it so much attention or it's cOol to have something that bothers me a lot but, sooo. It deals with either someone being better than me, which as you know. Irks me a lot, but also when they slack off  Take andre for example. The calc project is due tomorrow and he didnt even take a look at it till 7, actually one thing I just realized is that I'm taking everything he says as a fact, which in all honestly couldnt be the case! Also I think I bring people down a lot in my head/underestimate them to feel better about myself? Just saying all these wouldnt help, finding effective ways to deal with it does  Anyways as I was saying, I started the project kinda early and I think I'm done and understand the concept, now Andre is doing it and I feel pre angry if he finished it on time. I dont think theres a character that I relate to more than frank Grimes! Anyways, why would it make me angry, I guess it's because if I spent so much time working on something, if someone comes along and achieves it quicker or better than I do, then...well lookie here, he just said that he got the solution for that one, which in all honestly, I doubt he came up with by himself, dude I trust my gut feeling, well I'm even thinking of something else, wow this is a disorienting journal, but still, well, I do underestimate him!! And now idk if I underestimate him to feel better about myself or because I've seen that he struggles with new things. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself! I most likely am. Ara...focus on your life damit.  Will.this matter in 10 years. I should keep asking myself that, would Andre, or some random stranger that passes a class, bother me in 10 years! No it wont, if it doesnt bother me in 10 years, why bother now  ANYWAYS on a lighter topic, I watched turning red and my mum was there and it was prettt awkward but not at the same time hahah, it was a pretty good movie   ALSO I'm getting better at not biting my nails, scoreeeee. They arent growing as nice as I'd like but ita a dam lot better than when I was still biting them. Eugh classes tomorrow. Now I dont want you to keep thinking that if it doesnt bother me in 10 years, I shouldnt bother about it now cause it can then cause me to worry more about the statement and ep no time for that, worrying is too much work   OH and Spanish, dude I feel like I wanna get fluent, as before, but eee

    Entry: Ughh working all day, I realized that I just COULD NOT handle having all those files for the different touch screen tests and so on, so I devised a way to make it work with just one file. And for the non touchscreen iat, it did work!! But for the touchscreen, eyghh. Actually I might just copy the entire code for the iat and paste it in the touchscreen. Then after that see if it works, if it does, I'll switch out the data, workingnwith touch and keyboard shouldnt be that different, it shouldn't 😭. I feel like this is one of those things I'd spend an inordinate amount of time on. Ugh if it worked I would've been such a happy camper xD  Now I'm a sad ish camper, so what's the plan mi amigo, gonna dedicate the entire day tomorrow to working on it, hopefully once I get it done, I can switch out the name for the gender iat to images, and start on the race ones! I have two entire weeks and made a lotta progress in a day...eugh i have the honors thingy tomorrow

And wow all in one day, more like 5 hours of collective coding but still.  Tcomc is getting pretty interesting with the introduction of abbe. I wouldn't call it the level of furycks saga though. Hmmm what else, scp next week, Daniel tomorrow, gots to ask him about firebase rules so it doesnt interfere with miaos work,OH I also need to get the thingy signed for volunteering today...yes I did volunteer. Hmm gonna finish calc project tomorrow! Also gonna work on the part I dedicated to weekend for miao, aka making the changes to the gender iat. I'll start on the race iat on monday.   Eugh need to talk to dr mina about signing up for engr 1000. Also leading cru next week, I know I'll survive. Just...blech, gonna check things off slowly, also wanna take a summer class but parents would need to pay out of pocket and nope to that.  I miss birding ;(. Birds are so awesome, tiny bundles of happiness  Also had the strangest dream that I was in a relationship with leia XD. Anyways off to bed! Plans for tomorrow, wake up, get chores out of the way, coding club call, finish calc project !   Speaking of which, I still have horrible issues with envy, or mistrust, idk! I was taking the calc test and Andre went into the bathroom and I could only think about him cheating and it kept running around in my head and it makes me feel better when I get something that someone else doesnt eughhh  its such a trash feeling, gonna talk about it with the vanessa and chris next time I see them. All in all, what's on my plate   - calc - cru - job  And I guess that's it. I'll survive, I always do with the grace of God - look at me attributing lall my success to myself  :(  My brain is going into the preworry state so I'll stop it before it happens and let whatever happens on saturday happen! Follow the flow

He asked a question about if anyone remembers the 5 barriers of leadership and I answered twice and he came up to me and said I'd make a great leader, and that I'm smart, it was pretty awkward for me, and I tried to just think of it as him not noticing me before and realizing he hadn't given me attention so he did, but meh the compliment still bore into my head!  Anyways, RAIN. I love the rainnnnnn, highlight of the morning anddd evening, hope it rains even more woo! Didnt do cardio cause of the, ima just call it assutation - as situation xD

When I got that message on Friday, but it was related to someone else. I was thinking of her, maybe it was, I'm not sure. Hopefully her family is doing okay, I know it doesnt help them or they wont know I said it :(.   But yeah apart from that, lab went great as always, the class is so relaxed! And dr mina is great. Also speaking of code. Meh I dont wanna get into it, was going to say something along the lines of me being good at getting the basics of something down and algo asi, but its unnecessary and tooting my own horn   Edit  Brehhhh its 11 53 pm, I slept early!

    Entry: When do I get a rad day xD. Today was pretty goood tho, apart the end, soo, saint Patrick's day! The southpark episode was hilarious, I'll prolly rewatch it tomorrow, anyways, starting the day studying calc, then for the test, I finished pretty quickly and I didnt think it was that bad. Then andre finished and his answers were right, then envy struck! Wooopdedo, my brain was going into alll places like, when he was in the bathroom, what was he doing, oOoOo, it took him a long time to get it, idk some pretty disgusting places! It's even his birthday smh, anyways, yeah, I decided and somewhat ineffectively but exponentially better than letting the thoughts, or automatic thoughts as vanessa would put it to linger. Then we got our history midterm and I got the highest in the class! What an ego boost, I decided to finish one part of the reading when I got home, and I did!   Anyways, went to the gym. It was almost empty. Luke was there, then ben came! He complimented my shoulders 😭, but then the thought that hed think I'm on steroids popped up LOL. I guess that's the goal, to become big enough that people think you're on drugs even though you arent, pretty uncomfortable goal tho. Anyways I walked 10.5k steps today! Most from walking with ben to his car after the gym. He tried lifting 405 and got closer than last time! I was super worried about his form.and being injured tho, another thing I need to work on is my grip!! Same with for hanging leg raises, I have to stop picking at the calluses oml, anyways parents arrived super late. Like 10 50 and I had a cold shower just cause I was itching a lot. Also continuing reading under the same star and the book makes me feel weird in so many different ways! Headed to bed now though, I need to talk to dr Acevedo about summer internship, ew! And first, I gots to check whether I came to udm as undocumented, then set up a meeting with him. Tomorrows leg day woo!   Didnt get a chance to work on unity that much, but meh, also didnt get a chance to work more on miao, but I'm already in a really good place and I dont see anything more to work on, except the instructions which I will keep thinking of! I want to earn a total of 1k! Already at 852, 1000 minus that is around 148, and 148 divided by 13 is a bit over 10 so A BIT OVER 10 HOURS LEFT WOO! Gonna see what else I can work on! Maybe gathering more data. OH and I saw a bird eating another bird yesterday xD  OH and I wanna make a website for tenn!

Gonna start with studying the lhopital rule tomorrow in the library, and if I have time, keep working on the project, also going to round out my programming project and split the reading of the user input into a function! Ethan trusted me with his computer password and I feel so honored xd, I wasnt able to get his code for him tho :(.  ALSO, ugh the dude, you know hm, that walked down the path with his kid asked me for some money to buy food and I wasnt thinking and i feel bad now but i said i ddint carry my wallet with me and pretended to check my pocket ugh, what's done is donethough!:(   Also worked oit with andy and he left his phone xD. I'm also planning on creating a site for TENN!! what they use is pretty horrible! I wonder how it would work tho, I'd also use vite and typescript to do it. Anyways gonna head to bed now

    Entry: Less melancholic today! Dr barry emailed me about becoming a minor in english, got to let him down slowly. Skewl starts tomorrow! Idk why but I'm looking forward to seeing ben especially, idk if it's because I want to *stroke my ego*, dude I've been watching my girlfriend is a shobitch and the show is pretty nice xD  But yeah idk, just crossed my.mind that he did say I motivated him, and now I feel so young! Cherish the time you feel young mister! But sometimes I'm suddenly like, wow I feel super young. Finished the boys diabolical. Might sleep a bit earlier today too

    Entry: Todays my mums birthday and I ate a buck ton!! Didnt even eat breakfast or dinner, just the sustenance of the buffet which I guess was enough XD. Anyways i also being watched the second season of upload which is pretty good.  Apart from the semantic facts of my day, I was looking through reddit and saw something about the grown up equivalent of finding out that santa isnt real, and a buncha them was like, no matter how hard you try  you might not always succeed or the world isnt fair and thing like that and it kinda really got me thinking!  Like I would say I'm lucky in so many ways, reading under the same stars even drives that point home!!!! And even in basic things like karuta XD. Anyways, I would'nt say that life or God has been unfair to me. Sure people have it better than I do, but I also guess that's life! Another reason I really do think I jive with Frank Grimes is that its okay to be mad at it. Someone coasting through life while someone else works tooth and bone to reach half of what the other person achieved. It's so, not paradoxical, but, kinda saddening, cause I have 0 idea where my future will take me. I mean. I'm learning coding and I'm even settling with the idea of using typescript with vite and not being worried that I would be limited to only using typescript without vite in the future- tangent about how I feel I'm over relying on vite to learn/use typescript which to be fair I dont think is the case and I get to choose which technologies I want to learn or combine and I shouldnt let hypothetical situations dictate how I choose what I do, speaking of also which, miaos project is in a splendid place, BUT, butt.  I imagine myself in a fancy house with 2 and a half children but I also imagine myself falling pretty to this cruel faith called life, and I think even as I write this, I havent fully reflected on that sentiment...I stil remember mrs Cole's words tbh, I hope I still remember her when I get older but she said that when I get famous, I should remember her xD. ( another tangent, mrs bilesanmi commented on me on my mums post haha! ) but yeah! Moral of this quite long and thoughtful journal that I havent done in a long while, we can't control what life dishes out to us - duh, well, actually we can! To an extent, also brings up the idea of free will and everything!!!! Especislly with religion, but, butt, as for now, I'd like to believe I'm in charge of my fate, and rn I'm just waiting, and I hope that it never comes, actually, I'm not waiting for it to happen, if anything happens, I'll face it anyways,, it's not like I have a choice, so moral of the story, just keep swimming! Life is a long bird walk, sometimes you see a starling murmuration - still one of the best and memorable moments of my life so far!, other times you see just starlings and house sparrows, and other times, you fall in the mud while looking at the sky, geeeez this just got deep.  Moral FINALLY CAUSE I NEED TO REPEAT IT TO MYSELF, just..keep..swimming, and do what you love without regrets!! No regrets!!!! Now I'm gonna keep watching this messed up show - the boys diabolical and, I guess leave everything here, all the existential questions, free will, what the future holds, what is death. And to end it all...Fuck.

    Entry: Mehhh, so, decided to pick up the skill of typescript. Future me if you're reading this, how did it turn out, did you forget it or are you loving it, or maybe just indifferent. I decided to drop parcel and combine vite and typescript. Vite for the.... insert reason why I should learn either of those. It has been going through my head a lot whether it is worth it to learn either of them   Meh fudge it, WHY NOT. I'm now in a good place with miaos excel thingy, see, everything will figure itself our eventually, I guess it's the omg it's the same fear of not sticking with something, same thing I remember having with the radio on my previous phone!! Well, only way to get through something is to do the thing, so fudge it, I will use typescript and vite on my upcoming project. Another thing I fear a bit is using too many new things ay the same thing. I guess it's not too many, just vite and ts, but it does make me quite overwhelmed

    Entry: Today was pretty meh tbh, I didnt get super a lot done, but I did learn a lot more about linear approximation and practiced with it! Just have to understand some of the questions in the project. Have a buncha changes to make in the code, nothing extreme, a few tweaks to how the data is stored and the ui but it should be fine. I'm also thinking of learning typescript, which I might use for the grade site - just as practice for js, instead of just wishing to make it. Prolly should start designing it! Meh I'll usefirebase, I wont overthink using firebase cause it's a cool service thatd help me up my sites potential by adding a login functionality, and who doesnt want that. I'm also gonna use vanilla js with typescript and parcel.  Hmm what else, oh another thing. I might need to tweak my diet because I feel bloated. Like when training, it's like ma belly is sticking out, so yeah, gonna try some new things, but ughhh today was kinda a mediocre day  Feeling the need to write sth down, since with vanilla js, we cant import other modules or packages into our projects, we need module bundlers like parcel to help us do that  I'm gonna be combining a lot of new tech for this new project and it is making me a bit overwhelmed. Nothing drastic though, I'm thinking typescript with sass - just to keep up practice and I kinda like it -, combined with parcel and then vanilla js, which I havent used by itself in a long time- since I use vue now. I feel strange about the project, like I'm imagine a rope pulling me back so that I dont do it and I keep in my comfort zone, actually I am usually in my comfort zone! Even while working with miao, I'm at a point where I got the excel thing quite quickly and now I feel like I stagnated a bit. I might feel the need to sink into complacency [ also I think theres also a hint of the fear that I wouldnt finish or even start the project ] but what's the point of fearing failure when not only would i still learn, but I can always come back to it. Also my shoulder hurts :(

    Entry: Geez I keep being productive but havent really gotten into that flow state, I think I'm so used to the living room environment not for being productive that it doesnt register, at least not yet. Made a few design changes to the site to make it look a lot better. I also think I nailed the json data storing with excel, even though I'm not close to 80 percent sure how it works, but I'll look it over! Tomorrow. Gonna finish restyling the Individuation training, couldnt get the stimulus to stay in the same place tho, just minimized how much of an effect it made.   Still getting the hang of linear approximation but I think I've gone really far, I might even start approaching the project questions tomorrow after practicing a bit more on error propagation, I just hope he goes over all these again in class. hE BETTER, anyways, this week is going by pretty fast but also pretty slow.   Unity has been going quite well, making some nice progress. My plan to work till 12 and then chill and let the day take me is working quite really well, side note, need to talk about scp going in person. Shouldnt be that bit of a deal...I hope. Honors convocation thingy too, ugh. Ehhh what else what else, I havent done the vue course in a while :(. Apart from that tho! Actually I dont feel like I'm learning much again when it comes to vue, at least with the composition api. AT LEAST, got some good practice with setting up firebase, even though it is a hella a hassle. I always figure it out eventually, and if I dont I have the past code.   Started bajo la misma estrella, which reminds me, FINISHED HABITOS ATOMICOS >:) like I promised hehe. Anyways that's all for the facts of life, moving towards emotions, not sure really, just been chilling. Watching the Simpsons, not enough gintama xD. Also have been home alone for a while then past 3 days. Usually spend the time coding for miao. Also speaking of which, planning on making 1grand in total, which is pretty good!   Also on the topic of emotion, I just realized - thanks simpsons - the difference between jealousy and envy, jealousy is the fear that someone will take what you have while envy is wanting what someone has, I guess I usually fall somewhere where logically I dont care what someone has/It shouldnt bug me, and I wouldn't mind if I had it but it wouldnt change my life. It almost always boils down to the idea of dwelling on things tho! My parents are talking about taxes oop, dont know what that's about but I'll LEAVE IT TO THEM! if I dwell too much on something, it affects me a lot   Like in case of Ethan travelling or Andre and the rest having cool internships, i didnt dwell on it and normally, it would be something I'd love to do. Even right now I'm not jealous of Aaron, but more of full of wanderlust. That's a pretty nice word, wanderlust xD. Apart from that, finished john last night, where to continue 0-o. Summer is approaching and found out we have to register for a trash summer course, I just hope I can at least work with dr hill over the summer. Still stopping myself from seeing sky spoilers XD. Geez how long have I been writing..to sum up, 700 day streak on duolingo! REMEMBER WHEN I WANTED TO QUIT, the italian language is pretty interesting   Side note, I GOTs to eat less sugar, bajo la misma estrella got me thinking about the choices I make when it comes to the dang ice cream and my focus more on calories than health :( you know what! Gonna try something crazy, no sugar in the form of desert, or bread!!! Still somewhat infatuated with Laura from spanish after hours

Gots to have it down to a t. Home alone again which is pretty nice and watching vincenzo. It's so quiet!   Pretty productive day so far! Also worked out and did yoga which I havent done in a while. I feel pretty good when I'm being productive compared to when I'm just relaxing to be honest. After this episode of vincenzo, I might keep working on lineariztion or power query

Its not really something I want to talk about just cause it goes so deep and I dont wanna, disappoint myself or mess up our relationship >_<. Yeah, I'll keep that to me self >:). Reached a 700 day streak in duolingo!! Still learning italian and started a new show called vincenzo, still finishing gintama tho. The fitness server is turning out pretty fine if I do say so myself  :D  Mum made really good pizza and ambrosia salad and I told them about the, honors convocation thingy, hmmm, scp is going to be in person starting april, uch. Spring break started next week woo! It also feels so warmmmmmm. I'll probably be almost home alone tomorrow, fun!   I emailed miao about a bomb idea I had to store all the data for each individual block in one place and waiting for her response, I hope she says I should do it that way! If she doesnt, I'll just stick with the idea of grouping different users under different stimulus. So like IAT, - user1, User2. IRBT.. and so on. Almost forgot about that way, might also try to finish the history reading and gonna get back into 5 day yoga as part of this deload week ooooooh. TIM IM COMING FOR YOU

    Entry: Gonna be more active in leadership class. JUST SAY IT DAMIT, shouldve thought of that before I didnt really talk a lot. We had our prog quiz and I got a 10.666666 xd. Andre got a 12 which honestly, was surprising, this is a journal so blech I'm gonna say what I feel. Yeah I was surprised and a bit jealous, jUsT a BiT lol but yeah it didnt really feel good since, as you might know  I have issues with someone being better than me and even if I help someone, I still get that weird annoying feeling when someone outperforms me. Tracing it back to the jss1? Debate thingy when semilogun was awesome. Ugh I still remember how I felt, I was literally squeezing my paper, i wonder if anyone noticed. NOT EVEN ugh I also just felt that other feelingn I get when I was reminiscing, when my.brother shook my hand, i dont think our relationship was even bad then, it just wasnt good.   Now two feelings are tugging at my belly xD. First with feeling jealous, I mean that word works, when someone outperforms me. First let's address that, geez I need a therapist lol, hmmm, through middle school, I was 1st place, not only that, but also through central four years of being basically the highest GPA in the school! And now I've felt a bit of superiority, like, even when thinking about Ben, who is really trying!! But doesnt do as good as he wants to, it makes me feel weird, I dont put in nearly as much work I'm sure, and when I lose my "spot", even to caleb, i don't wanna say which makes no sense, but yeah SAME THING WITH WHEN MY BROTHER STARTED EXERCSING. Looking back at it now, I feel kinda ish dumb but not really because I still feel that way in little things!!!   So focusing on that, I still dont see why, like I catch myself feeling them feelings, and I recognize that I should be happy for them, and sometimes I'm happy! Hm, I guess and it almost always is when I dwell on things that they tend to get out of control and I feel that way. Like in my brain with my score, it made me feel like - oh others will think I'm now dumber? I cant even think of other justifications but yeah   So now I've recognized that I feel jealous when I dwell on little matters especially, a lot of times, when I make this realization too, I try to make myself not dwell so much on it and that's something I'll need to get better at. It also makes me feel weird about if that's how everyone else feels about me!! Cause since I put myself, directly or indirectly on a pedestle, I am for sure making someone feel less about themselves. Like maybe this is how Andre always feels!!! I dont know, I cant see into other peoples heart and a lot of times I try to be humble, but when it comes to things like grades, mann, I feel weird.  Okay so I've talked about feeling jealous, and I'm going to dwell less on matters, like if I ask myself does this affect MY life and omg I realized I havent even brought up God into this, but also ask for help when it comes to feeling bad about myself on behalf of other people. This is a long journal dang, anyways. Oh but another issue is that when I try not to dwell on an issue, it's like I'm trying to well not ignore thay someone did something good, but it sometimes feels like self soothing, and I guess that even though it would be considered self soothing. Its better than self hating and it everything I say is factual, there no reason to believe that its self soothing   Also talk about procrastinating, I feel like I haven't been focusing so much on my todo list, ugh speaking of which I have my call withmiao tomorrow. One thing at a time and spring break is coming! SO. I'm going to try and finish everything I have on my wishlist rn, study for calcs quiz tomorrow because we are going over related rates!! Which is something I'm not great on :*]. Unity can wait in all honesty, same with my other projects!  In resolutionnn, imma go do ma work, add the emotional.booklet thingy to my todo. Frick I need the book. And I'll cya later

    Entry: Feeling a lot better about thewar, kind of. Anyways, I felt super jacked after today's chest day! I need to take note of my form tho, idk theres now this mental barrier when I lift on bench press, pretty strange, anywaysss! Volunteering tomorrow woop woop   Still practicing italian and something I want to work on is being more articulate like caleb! Makes me jealous xD. I try not to be tho, everyone's born with their innate strengths, I have mine, you have yours, we all have it hombre! I guess life is just about finding it. I started wondering what I'm good at. I guess I have pretty good memory and a grasp of understanding complex topics. I wonder how true that is tho or just me failing to acknowledge my ignorance   Well my work ethic has been said to be pretty good. I guess it is! Always trying to get the perfect balance of no work and just enough time for myself. I for sure need to work on my ability to talk to other people better, OH that reminds me, I met dr hill and he talked to me about internships and talking to Richard.   HE DID MENTION that if there was going to be extra time, wow I didn't even think over the conversation but going over it filled me with excitement, he might want me to help over the summer, he prolly does BUT no expectations, calm yourself young one.  I find that I do that a bit more than usual, so instead of getting overly excited, I try to calm myself and focus on plausible expectations. Speaking of which, idk why I get bored quite easily, idk if it's all in my head or not. Usually like you know, I study calc in the library every morning, I guess saying that is reinforcing the habit, but, I guess I forgot where I was going with that xD. I wanna ripen out my anime site, and once I do that, hmm. I'm not sure, start on the grading site! I imagine, like a cool dashboard thingy, that'd be nice.   Before I forget, feeling displaced, another emotion i think I'll add. Baxk to it, when walking with others today earlier, I felt pretty displaced, like just a shell of meat walking, It felt like even though I was there, I wasnt really there, like a side character in an anime xd. Also gonna start speaking up more in leadership class cause it's a honking leadership class.  That might be all for today...my strengths, feeling displaced, I'll update the emotions soon, plans for future, and so on

    Entry: Oh gosh its yesterday today XD. Stayed up to help Andre with his work. Anyways with the whole war thing, I've been noticing a new feeling, I think I'm a bit used to it now but its such a weird feeling in my center chest, like a fear of the unknown as things could swing either ways, I dont know its unlike anything I've felt before. I do think that taking a more cynical view of life could make things muchhh more easy! Like well we all die anyways and at the end of the day, single lifes dont matter, but that's depressing and doesnt achieve anything   At least I know not to fear wars/rumors of wars, and even saying that doesnt feel me with as much dread as it used to. Tomorrows gonna be a pretty chill day hopefully, watching arcane which is pretty good, thanks Etan. Also feeling tired, duh. SKY ALSO HAD THE UPDATE AND THE KIZUNA AI HAIR! And new shares spaces and new event omg it makes me so excited, itching literally, like I can feel it pulsing from my feet around my body XD. Marvellous feeling  Tomorrow, I finish the history study guide and I think do some studying on the previous ones that I'm not clear on, work on my last page for miao! And probably make more changes to the unity code

    Entry: I'm feeling super stressed about everything and the war and ughhhhh!!!!! If I were to trace the source of my fear, I would say that it is partly because I dont know how things will turn out. It makes me uneasy that there are people dying ( even though people already die ) and I cant do anything about it. That's one benefit that I'd say distancing myself from news will bring. I really dont like this feeling and it's not overcast but it is like a looming threat of the unknown future! Also scared about the potential that where we are rn is going to be attacked, nuclear scale disasters, and so on!   There are ao many things that could go wrong and there can also be a happy end to things, I don't know. I'm trying to remember the words of God that stressing wouldnt add any more hours to my life and I'd be better off not stressing at all. Things are going to happen that I cant change and I cant deny change from happening. Another worry I want to get on paper is the fact that It might all impede my future plans and goals which is something that irks me. At the end of the day, it would not last forever! And remember, stressing does not change the situation a bit, I'm one boy in michigan, specifically Detroit and worrying about war wouldn't change the outcome of anything.  I'll distance myself from the news since it's the best way I've found not to worry over it so much.  BREH just got an email about it xD

So first, I think calc quiz went well, I saw that the russian ukraine thing is escalating and its making me pretttty nervous. Super nervous and scared. I've already seen what's happening and dont want it to spread here. Also scared for other people and frustrated! Apart from that, my call with miao was rescheduled, I fell in ice while puddle ice skating with simon xD, the counseling meeting was pretty good, but this war thing has been a drag over my head and I feel like I'd get too involved and worried so I deleted reddit. I dont want to be ignorant but I also want to draw a line between living scared of everything.   Also worried about the drafting thingy, I know a lot of people are also worried badly!

Itd be nice knowing that I have all I wanted to do done  EDIT  OH ELEMENTAL BATTLEGROUNDS RELEASED THEIR NEW ELEMENT SOLAR AND I GOT JOJO IN KARUTA HAHA  More edits   Looking back at my journals, I realize how much of myself has been about eating right and looking good. Like I made it control my day and I'm super glad to see that's not really happening anymore.  Sure I stil mention when I overeat or when I feel not great about my body but it's much less and now I'm focusing on other parts of my life here. Also need to stop with all the sky pictures xD

Have to message my mentor. Apart from that, I emailed dr miao, and drafted the email for its. I'm gonna work on cleaning up the code. Which I think is already pretty good >:(. The project got extended and I'm a lil salty but it's all good xD  Sadly I havent been seeing or noticing any good birds lately, maybe stopping using my phone while walking will help. I broke the rule but was conscious of when I did!!. Trying to depend less on my phone. LASHONDA TEXTED LOL. I've been mini putting off replying but ehh, shes great.   I DID CARDIO YAY, 35 mins on the elliptical while watching southpark. I wanted to use the gym showers but ALAS, no towel >_>. No chance of me sneaking one in my bag unless I lived on campus. Speaking of which I wanna save money to live on campus but then saving money for a car in the future is probably the better bet. Ehhh what else   Calc quiz tomorrow, I'll do good by the grace of God. Trying to make that a habit too. Incorporate more of God into my life. Once I get home - using integration implementation from atomic habits -, I'm gonna try out the razor! Then clean up my code. Actually, I'll do a bit of history studying with coding!  DONE, FEELS SO AIRY

    Entry: You know what, I'm feeling RADDDD  I havent used this in a while. Chest day was awesome, technically upper day. Did planks while listening to English ist mein lieblingsfach xD. Lifted 165 on bench press woop woop, i dont know why my.brain is still in the idea that I can't keep getting new records but I know dam well that I can >:).   Sky new quest is outttt and I'm almost 100 percent done with my.project, the only issue is that I need to make the array dynamic, BUT, its multidimensional so I'm not sure how it works, I'm just gonna ask dr mina on wednesday, I should probably make a comment.  Also making some design changes and updates to my project with miao and it makes it look better which makes me hapi!!! Its looking better responsive. I updated my portfolio project with my project fit, which I think was a success woo pwoop! I'm probably gonna update it some more in the future :D   Hmm what else, lab went swimmingly, for me at least. I was so close to a bonus point by myself xD. Made a mistake. Anyways, I'm gonna need to help ben with his project tonight which would NOT be fun at all :*). Ugh the project is going to be difficult for some people and idk but theres a special feeling of wanting to be able to explain things to someone but not being articulate enough. Something I'd need to work on, condensing more info in little time!   Also happy valentine's day xD

    Entry: Glad it's the weekend. Had a really nice call with dan and I realized I want to freelance/start my own business!! Working with dr miao made me realize that it's pretty boring working for someone else! I'd like to work on my own projects, like the tiny fitness site I'm working on now heh. Komi cant communicate is really funny!!   Also I wanna spend less time on my phone!! Also the weather is hot eeeee. Summer foreshadowing. I also think I made a breakthrough in Caleb's and ethans project! I do feel kinda bad that I'm taking away from ethans job >_<. I want them to still collaborate and him to learn more BUT ME using this opportunity to learn more isnt bad in the slightest and I'm happy to do something that is practical!!!@   Also mrs vanita from scp said something along the lines of - she heard great things from me from JOURNI people hehe - I can imagine it was Richard xD. Guess I have a bar to set now. DAMMIT just found a bug in fitness site xD. Wait no I didnt, the server just isn't up xD

    Entry: My knee hurt during my leg workout, always the left side oml. Hmm anyways, I feel super tired, well, unusually tired. Didnt feel like this at skewl. Worked on calculus for a few hours today. Okay so here's a mini rant that I I jjst need to get off my chest. I feel like Frank Grimes. So here's the schtick. Andre doesn't really study for calc ( ugh I feel like a bad friend ) and the work in calc class is pretty easy luckily, the lectures are ahead of our quizzes, so while I study for what is being lectured. But before the quiz, andre watches yt videos to catch up.  Its not that its Andre's problem, it's something I'm feeling in general, like Frank Grimes. So Frank-YOU KNOW THIS - basically worked his life to get where he is, yet someone - homer XD - coasted through life and has MORE than what grimes is, and grimes got really angry and I honestly relate to Grimey!!! I get he took his anger out on the wrong person but ehh.    I try to be glad that Andre is passing the class and doing well even without studying a lot - doing the homework- but its just quite irking. But now I guess this is how other people feel about me in computer science. For some people they need to study hard to get sth, while i usually get it quickly. Which reminds me that I need to look over the lecture xd. But you get it!   At the end of the day, it doesnt hurt me, it doesnt hurt me, I'm not studying to prove I'm better than others, I'm studying to make sure I understand the content and someone else's habits should have no effect on my own! I'm learning the chain rule and then the implicit derivatives. I think I've gotten really far in the chain rule and made some good progress! Even now I'm thinking and irking about how Andre will just watxh a YouTube video to bypass my working it. But then that makes no sense! Because I also used youtube and even though i spent like 2 hours studying, I learnt a lot! And it's going to help me, which Is who I should focus on, ME.

    Entry: Came home after 9!!!! Haven't done a good journal in what feels like forever. Reading atomic habits and I found some bugs in the test codes and idk, just cause of how complex things are make me feel like I made a mistake somewhere and messed sth up, and it's kinda rigid, I'll have to let her know about the rigid trials thing. But one of my main worries is that I'll mess her data or sth👁👄👁💧  I was able to make the iat data half half which was pretty nice but testing it is ugh. OH BTW I'm helping ethans brother with some files coding thing I think is pretty interesting so I think I'll work on that when I have a lotta free time. Also my advanced workout site is coming pretty well. Should I wake up early tomorrow.well technically sleep late today, yeah I think I will. I wanna get some good progress on the site, its almost done, just the styling and timer.   Then I'll add it to my portfolio and make some few tweaks to my portfolio. Then. Start the ecommerce site and learn a buncha new stuff woop woop!   I had a super big hit of imposter syndrome too because I feel like dr Miao would feel like I'm trash at coding or someone from the future will see it or sth idk!  Also my back HURTS, 3 hours of fleeping sitting on leadership class plus deadlifts eepe

    Entry: Lab was pretty fun today! And Andre and I met up with Ian. I finished project 1, for the most part, alegs came back, I wanna buy a new phone XD, about to go to bed, also fell out of the habit of reading the bible :(. To compensate, I think I'll watch a bit more of bible project, speaking of which, cru tomorrow!  Today was also chest day and something was weird with my left wrist vein or nerve? So I lifted light on last set of inclines but it started mid way through flats. Reached my strength back in bp - 155, and I'm approaching it on the incline! I could reach 145 but when wrist ugh. Planks arent going good tho :*l.   Days of love started in sky and I am ABSOLUTELY LOVINGGGGG THESE back to back sky eventssss, I feel like they're bringing me closer to others and Lama and I are on the level that nyny and I am on now! I should probably go to bed tho, igh I have history, the teacher is good yeah, the content, eh... class ends at 12 35 so I can probably hit the gym then have lunch.  Havrnt seen Aaron in a while :(  My dads still studying for his stuff and idk, I feel bad for him but I can't do much, it's his battle. Anyways I'm still reading atomic habits in spanish and geez it's a long book but I'll finish it! Italian learning with duolingo is going steady, I'm at the point where I think I know more than I do!! Like I worry more about spanish than italian, maybe its because I know how much I dont know in spanish, speaking of that, grammar messes me up a lot and I get worked up about with preposition to use or words in a sentence ughhh. Probably need to start with the basics

    Entry: FINALLY TOLD HER OML  Edit 2 55  I find myself worrying more about the future, especially when I reminisce because I do not want to go back to Nigeria!!!!! Theres nothing absolutely bad about it, but i feel like theres going to be a lot of danger, and I dont want to go back to that environment after witnessing something really good. We all are legal, but I dont know my parents plan, I'm pretty sure it's to get a green card through working, like my dad said, but I really should live in the present   What happens will happen!! I cant be worrying about things that have a low probability to happen and that I have no control over. Cant add any hours to my life like this!

Anyrayss, now that the scp has started and theres a chance we will be meeting IN PERSON UGH, its once a month every first saturday and I know but I still need to let my parents know, or my mum at least AND IDK WHY I AM FINDING IT SO DIFFICULT WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH ME.  I'm coming up with plans and strategies and talking points to something so basiccc, fear of disappointment to me or the receiver maybe?! Same thing with telling Daniel I couldnt come to the meeting ughh, I did it. But Ughghtgjtvtjrnks. Tomorrow I was just planning on being like, I started a new program and they gave us a gift card. I want to use it to buy something to eat for lunch. I mean that works!! But ughhh things like this happen so many times, not really, but I'm just tight lipped about certain things and talking about it is so frustrating!  I WAS ALSO SUPER FREADING BORED LIKE BORED OIT OF MY MIND FOR THE AFTER SECTIONS OF THE SCP CALL. Then I had to help my mum with her work ;-;

I think my grip had a factor to play in it but I do need better shoulder strength and probably ro learn more about the form cause this morning my shoulder neck and chest were soreeeeeeeE. Also saw ben in the fitness center. Cru was pretty fun too.  Playing sky has also been a joy with so much waxzzz

    My mood bad
    
    Entry: Okay still bad, but! Looking back at my journals, I'm gonna take my advice and compartmentalize my thoughts into worries and todos   Worries - I am not going to enjoy the scp program, it is a waste of time, I didnt really do it because I wanted to and never had any interest in the beginning, and I should learn how to say no!   - I'm doing just horrible with my job and a lot of things are basically superglued together, I have no confidence in my code and think its gonna break   - I'm getting burnt out and need to take some days to rest but school is still going, I have the coding club, miao, now the scp, and so on.   I guess at the end of the day I should figure out my needs and my wants or even just time occupiers. Like my side project is a time occupier, me signing up for the scp is an wanted obligation and I should stick to it. What's the point in giving up something before it starts, something that also has the potential to be interesting and impactful!   Now to dos. Mostly tell my parents about it. ITS NOT THAT HARD, IT LITERALLY IS NOT THAT HARD, ILL DO IT NOW!! But idek what to say- if you get an email from something called scp, it's a program that richard Introduced me too, its basically just a call every month talking about WHAT IDK. Okay so, first I'll see what the schmuck is all about!! FUCK! So now todo   See what the program is about tomorrow - not a big deal. Lord give me the strength to handle this. Geez I've been trying to handle everything by myself. There are better things to worry about, which is nothing, I just have to let things go by! That introduced another worry, scale. I feel like it's so long that I am going to feel trapped,  but i guess i realize it is once every month! A 3 hour call once a monthhhh is not going to kill me. If we go in person, I guess I'll have to call a uber or something!  In the spirit of taking things one step at a time, my first step is to see what its about. Go to the call tomorrow, then let parents know

    Entry: I do feel pretty awful. I miss school, luckily it starts back up on monday, I have the scp call tomorrow and code club call. I've been more busy than this but I do feel bad and burnt out to be honest. So I'm gonna not do any work over the weekend, nor on saturday even!!! I do deserve a break eep. Like, I stopped learning unity, still need to keep learning vue composition api, working on psychology work, my side project, blah blah. I'll make it work, just got to get through saturday  Edit   Took a cold shower and I'm better now but I really dont feel like doing this strategic community partners thing and I hope its virtual fir the rest of the year ( highly doubtful ) but I already signed up and cant back out now. Tbf I didnt really want to get this and didnt do anything impressive on the application ughh. Also my stomach hurts UGH. Also there's a dam rat crawling somewhere lol. There are technically only 11 sessions and tomorrow is from 1 to like 11:30. Another thing is letting my.parents know, something I'm REALLY bad at for some reason. Like I'd over think even the smallest thing, even for my dad even though I'm mostly worried about my mum. I'll wait for the call tomorrow and see what it's all about >->. Take things one step at a time and you'll find your way. also this is nothing compared to the feeling that I would have to take the sat that time and when I broke it to misha... dont remember her name :*) one time I'm kinda worried about tho is the program being in person and driving to where they are

    Entry: I really wasnt feeling my workout today and tried to make arguably the hardest ( the way I tried it at least ) change that dr miao suggested. It kept giving me a buncha errors and I gave up on it and did a simpler solution but it still feels very weird to me. It's a feeling i only get with not understanding code, like an overcast centered around not being able to get sth to work. Same with the trials. I was working pretty hard on it yesterday and got it to work but I'm SUPER TIRED OF THIS PROJECT LOL. This is the seventh week and next week is technically when the project should end. I'm at the finish line and would love to dump this project and start working on sth fun. Then tbh I really cant control that much what I work on if I'm not working for myself :(.   Hmm so what's the leeson, nothing really. Just wanted to get the feeling off my chest. Cant wait to start skewl in person again. I feel like I've gained more weight now than over quarantine- prolly not true and would enjoy the activity more and I can also be more productive. I also have the spc call tomorrow. I'm not gonna start pre worrying about it or thinking about the dread that itd bring xD. Its gonna be a new experience that I'll make sure to enjoy. Anyways I'm watching and southpark now and I'm gonna try to finish this code

Its like a dread of the unknown, my mindddd, where the code comes from, why it works, why it doesnt work, it IRKS ME. I wonder if I'll ever abandon software dev. Anyways still learning italian, I didnt watch as many videos today, had group counseling that was super fun!   Watched a buncha the simpsons, did my history quiz and got 9/10 AGAIN. Hmm what else, calc quiz, call with dr miao went pretty well. She gave me some changes to make that wouldnt take long, probably just a day or two tbh. I'll spread out the work to keep working on my fitness site to keep me fresh B). I dont like working on logic eee. Like, figuring out how to make a data set and show it in a game y way. It's something new for sure, but also something I wont want to continue.   I continued reading berserk too and I'm tired rn!   My handstand training is still going and I feel stronger on certain things, still need to work on a full pickup and holding for long but I'm getting there! Cant wait to go back to the gym too woop woop.

Then did ma classes and took test for prog class. I didnt go to the gym but I did work out at home. Anyways, start of leadership class, music and it felt like a flipping seminar which I guess it is. Anyways played chess with Andre, and my back hurts. I met a bunch, technically like 5 new people. Got 3 of their snapchats I'm sure I will NEVER use, 80 percent sure at least. I gots to buy the leadership pamphlet before wednesday next week. I'm getting more hearts in sky too >:)  Anyways I felt a bit overwhelmed. Just a bit, we finally started going over algorithms in programming 2 and I can imagine how someon who didnt take programming 1 felt :*)   So apart from thattt. Have calc quiz tomorrow I'm not really sure why I am worrying about calc, I understand what we are going over, and if I don't I can look through the textbook! And he also has office hours and I can watch the recorded lectures!! I'm understanding essentially everything so far. But I think I'll start again from chapter one to make sure   For prog 1, I'll understand as I go

Idk why I decides to start doing both. Some low intensity cardio after handstand practice. I just wish I had like the bicycle or treadmill. Also snowed today! Snow makes everything better

Cien anos de Soledad was really confusing with a lotta confusing names and story line and I'm not there yet, i will most likely revisit in the future. La alquimista was a really interesting book and I still think it is!   Went to the arcade today and it was pretty fun!! Also still going on italian. Io, tu, Lui. Lei, nois, vois, loro. Il is for the with consonants and l' with vowels. Una and un for articles, pretty similar to spanish. Speaking of spanish, I was able to for the most part old a conversation with brit and haru :D

    Entry: Just finsihed furycks saga and I want to cry. Alexsander, derwa, evaine, draguta, briggit, IVAAR, all died and more 😭 the series was a fricking emotional rollercoaster. I think it takes the cake for my favorite book. I think the end arc, then the tarak arc, then the tuura arc were my favorite. Eydis also dissapeared :**(. I'll start cien anos de Soledad either tomorrow or next week Monday! Also started my shoppi project because I was looking back at my old projects and seeing how creative I was. Doing this more data oriented project is not that creative and I wanna work on something new. Maybe shoppi is too big to start, I do have some ideas hmmm. Like the random exercise generator app >:).   I wonder if I should use it as a warm up and try using the composition api for it, it shouldnt be bad and will take me, at most a day. Theres also no routing :hmm:. I'll do that!  I'll make it dice like witb form videos and have a rest timer! Okay now I'm feeling excited  :D just a fun project before I get with the big guns. Got a 9/10 on history which irks me but it's okay, calc quiz was also okay, we have recitations tomorrow. Imma do the homework, read ahead for history, and rework on the IRBT. I think that's all I have to focus on, skewl, miao, and my exercise app. Itd be a kewl warmup  Side note I should get a real life sticky note, or just write on the side of my computer, I know I'm not gonna forget what I need to do, I have my to do sticky note and tabs open, just a little disconcerting

    Entry: Eep I feel pretty stressed, not especially because of leadership class. To be fair I'm at a pretty good spot with my job. For leadership, we need 8 hours of service learning which I wanna get over with now. The thing is that classes are still online though and I kinda wanna get it over with NOW. Anyways I'm a bit stressed about whether I'd be able to get it done, and I guess I have to realize that more opportunities will come in the future where I'll be able to volunteer! EVEN LAST semester tbh, I helped joy with a few things - technically less than a few xD and norman too.   For my job, nothing much to day about it. I wonder why I feel stressed a lot when it comes to it. Maybe some imposter syndrome, thinking I wouldnt be able to figure something out. I guess that could be it, in other physical lines of work, its just doing stuff, but when it comes to problem solving and using knowledge to solve a problem, there is a possibility that I wont know how to solve it, which could cause me stress, just brainstorming hm. Also reading code is like understanding a totally different language, at least it's making my brain more wrinkly   Oh and another thing, leadership is now in person which I think is my main one, so I'd have to make it a habit of going to school every Wednesday,  at  least if classes stay offline   Ugh I do not like staying in front of a camera for 2hrs anyways what else is on my mind. I'm trying to reach something but it's not in my reach uhh. Hmmm. Nothing really, I'm hungry.   Oh and frick I forgot what I was gonna say. Somethings floating in my head but I'll get it down soon enough  Took me way too long to realize I'm feeling overwhelmed. Well, I'm putting a name on the feeling of grasping at straws in my head. So putting everything to rest, for the leadership pin, thatd need to be worked out over my college years and not just right now so I shouldn't worry too much about it. For my service hours, I'll be on the lookout for opportunities and grab the ones I can, for leadership class being online, yay! No sitting for 2 hours in front of camera. I can easily start going to school on wednesdays like I've been before.

Also gonna have to work on the study guide for history eeee.   Anyways, oh I had a call with ben yesterday!! Classes are online for next week too ;-;. My dad started his school and he seems pretty stressed about it, I hope the work gets a bit easier for him. I find myself worrying a lot about the money thoo, like me in college plus mofe plus feeding us XD plus his school. It's pretty mind belching but I think they have their own way to do it.   Hmm, what else, I should STOP SPENDING MONEY ONLINE HAHA. THE SKY TRAVLLING SPIRIT WAS DISMISS AND I SHOUTED HAPPILY, MORE LIKE SQUEALED WHEN I SAW IT LOL. Also I get so worked up over misinformation in fitness, boils my blood eeeep. Speaking of which. Handstands! Gonna progress my practice to another vid I found that's pretty good. Focusing on handstands yay :D. I feel like I'm missing something. Woke up, made sweet potatoes, worked on history, calculus today and tomorrow which is pretty easy or calm so far. Cru went well, I'm still loving the cold weather! I really feel like I'm missing something XD  I've been pretty productive with my todo list tasks, did a lotta leadership work beforehand but I still need to read the student leaders dont blech. SO CLOSE to finishing furycks saga eeee. The war is drawing nearer. I'll follow my dad to pick my mum tomorrow so I can full focus! Also gonna ask him a bit about his skewl   Cant think about what I'm missing so cya xD

Apart from that, skys new season started hahaha. It was pretty funnn. I'm feeling so lost with my workoit plan, and my cut started good but went eh today. OH AND I found a way to get the pass by connecting my paypal account to google hahahaha  Also gonna have to work on IT tomorrow.  I feel super super super lost :(| so super lost. Where to move forward, so I can either use jefit and a premade workout for myself, or keep goin with the normal handstand routine. I wonder how long I've been working on it, I started around December iirc, so close to a month and a week?  Lol actually just about a month now XD. I'm not really sure how much my progress has done, my wrist feels a bit stronger but still pretty weak. I'm not sure if I should focus exclusively on handstands and not alternate with core work. I think I will focus on handstands for now, I dont even think my shoulders have gotten stronger :(.   Hmmm I'll bite the bullet and focus exclusively on handstands, I havent done yoga in a while either and mixing in core with handstand with yoga and cardio is not a good combo so focusing on one, handstand, should help settle me

    Entry: I feel kinda weird but under the circumstances, today was a great day. Didnt do much but relax,  had some delicious food at the buffet restaurant, starting my cut tomorrow woop woop, gonna start sticking to more basic toned down meals, kinda hehe. Gonna also set a steady routine, have some free time tomorrow too! No skewl so I'll read chapter 18 of history, work on the IT for miao,   Oh wow, the dread feeling went away for that XD. New season starts tomorrowwww I was hoping to stay awake till midnight but reset is at 2 😭😭 tomorrow then. Gotta charge my phone, speaking of which the battery has been pretty trash, new phone time? >:) I dont wanna have to take money from my parents bank account ><. Maube I can use amazon and combine the gift cards I have?? Ugh anyways, reading Matthew's and I'm gonna finish furycks saga sometime this month eee.

    Entry: It's so amazing how random circumstances can lead to good things. Like when I went out with my dad and saw the northern flicker, now I was scrolling through quora of all things! And saw this article on someone using steganography to decrypt an imagine blah blah, so i thought I'd give the mlh stenograohy challenge another go, so I randomly found this great site, and I was looking through the postcard and found the TO THAT WAS MISSING, so I texted ethan and was like IVE FOUND THE TO, then he found the FLAG WOOP WOOP, so the challenge is solved hahaha, now I'm looking how to exploit an exe .   Played sky with nyny and lama and went to eden! 8 hours of sleep again, and we are going to buffet place tomorrow!!! And idk whether I wanna start cutting, to be honest, why not, winter is getting close to being over. I guess I'll start tracking again, AND THIS TIME, FOR REAL

    Entry: Did some mlh challenges and solved a few ones that released some gooood endorphins! Also threw AJ a happy birthday party in sky 🤣🤣   OMG WE CAN ADD MORE THAN ONE PICTURE ON DAYLIO HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS  Its probably cause of my premium XD  Anyways, I had a call with dr miao, she gave me some feedback and tomorrow, the ONLY THING IM GOING TO DO, I'm watching you future me, is to look through both IATS, fix errors/bug and HOPEFULLY find that stupid bug in the keyboard version that's not showing up in the touch version, I might have to rework the whole keyboard code. She also said I will have to give some basic training to them people she works with haha! I gots to finish the leadership info sheet, and I only have one class tomorrow, calc. I really need to take my time with this, limits arent super hard but I do get confused and hope the recitations can help, especially for the really confusing questions. Might also have to watxh some YouTube videos too.  Online counseling wasnt actually bad, Vanessa hurt her shoulder, I hope shes well, currently sitting on toilet seat XD. I did some leg workout today and worked on handstand. My neck is pretty sore, not sure what happened. Dr Acevedo also sent me an email saying I hadn't registered for handshake. PSHAW I know I did smh, I emailed him back, yay past me. I felt kinda overwhelmed today, not to an extreme extent tho and I think I have things mostly underwraps, the only thing I need to get down is the code for miao. I wont say the project is super boring, but it doesnt appeal to my creative child eee >-<. Working on those challenges was really interesting and boosted my mood, like on a bigger scale than winning a chest game MY SHOULDER KEEPS BUGGINF ME WITH ITS TIGHTNESS OMG.  I'll keep working on it tomorrow    I should also take notes on limits instead of just listening!

Unexpected but welcome I guess, my brother told him to come in WHICH NEVER REALLY OCCURED TO ME thinking back. Hindsight is always 20 20, I should watch more donut operator vlogs. I think I've gotten over savvy :), whenever I see the name I stil think of him WHY AM I TALKING LIKE HES DEAD. Anyways, jesca is so fricking talented what the heck   Leadership class looks okay, I havent really formed an opinion on it, doesnt really matter tho. What elseeee hmm, I split my desktop intro three for skewl and my job, nothing and mlh, which is going pretty good. Played sky with the folks > prolly should get ready for bed. Only two classes tomorrow but just one technically   Also didnt do much coding today, or any at all, just fixed some bugs. Still need to work on the feedback page, I'll try to do that tomarrow  Frick I wanna work on my handstands but also on my core strength but also cardio and yoga. Wow bodyweight training is pretty diverse and fun, illcombine handstands with cardio tomorrow

I should also follow my dad so I can actually focus on furycks saga and not get distracted but I'd need to vaccum now  OH and I realize how trash my core strength is, definitely sth to work on. So I'm gonna alternate between doing the core workout and the handstand training cause my wrists have been hurting

    Entry: Okay so luckily no reading for phl class tomorrow and I saw ms Yates today. Okay sooo, coding. I re started on my work for Dr. Miao, I wonder how long she expected it will take for the normal person to finish the work. She said I was doing things quickly, but I wanna make sure I'm doing things well so I'm starting from the top - the IAT, and making things child friendly but also trying to clean up the code if possible 😅. I also dont use emojis in these, I should XD. Anyways, it made me realize how much I have to do, and I feel a bit overwhelmed, but as apple and onion sing! Take things one step at a time, and I'll find my way. So the next step for me is to tweak the survey page to look nice for children. Also found a cool color scheme, pink and blue go really well.   Hmm let's see. I havent watched Kristina's video in a while!!! I wanna binge watch while coding tomorrow. I'm also slowly getting through the vue course. Fudge unity, it can fudge my fudgicles smh xc. I'm trying to get my handstands to a good place, I might need to take a day off cause my wrists be hurting. Future me, have u learned the handstands yet :(. Gonna make some sweet potatoes tomorrow, even after philosophy class I have really nothing to do so I'll try a new approach, I'll set a coding goal for tomorrow! Instead of just having a buncha things I need to get done and cancelling it off the list, I should try to at least make things interesting and see if I can reach the goal. My goal for tomorrow will be to revamp the survey page. I'm still a bit iffy about how to store the information and whether firebase is the best way to do it but whatever, it works.

It's like, the cold is makingnmy eyes water so I spent the first half of the day crying involutarily lolll, I wonder how the nose and eyes are connected, now listening to dos oruguitas encanto is so flipping sad sometimes. Apart from that tho, I feel like I've been getting fatter ;-;, or maybe more bloated! Maybe holding one to more water or just eating a lot more, leaning on the latter.   DAM COVID. first 2 weeks of school is online, flipping fiddle Dee 😭😭 like philosophy wasnt already annoying enough. ALSO that means leadership book...poof. cant get it, I'll just wait till the first day of class and see what they have to say! Also last night was super hard to sleep cause of congested nose, it's a bit better now...I had a dream and Michael was there! And ogo too, I cant believe I forgot his name in the dream! I had this major fear of growing up and responsibilities blah blah, i mean it's a very valid fear tho, but not something I can control nor stop, so no use worrying over it. Did some preemptive listening for Thomas equinas lecture today

Started reading book 6 of furycks saga and I forgot so much happened!! Rojo blance y sangre azul was okay but I got bored of it. After I finish furycks saga. Imma read cien anos de soledad, if that's boring, back to dragonsblood suckerrs   I hope I dont have covid, my dad has been coughing, and my younger brother. I should also probably eat more healthy, like OATS, I used to enjoy oats, what made me stop taking it...HONEH, I SHOULD TAKE OATS WITH HONEY I think I did this before idk hoe. So anyways I'll take that tomorrow morning cause theres jack squat to eat here, speaking of squats, did my hiit today woop woop, but that's just two days a week and i didnt really do yoga, I've still been practicing handstands and have been noticing slight improvements, like a bit more control when i kick up to being able to hold if for like 2 seconds a bit more consistently, it feels quite a bit of hit or miss tho :(, I should gargle salt water fricking past me why you no think

Okay so, yeah still weird, anyways, I feel like I should be doing more again, I know I shut down the feeling pretty quickly but kinda succumbed to it, I dont really know, it seems like ukw is working on something and then it reminded me that I haven't really coded in a few weeks, or 2 weeks lol, also that I still have the ecommerce site, and I'm not really a fan of unity!!! Not necessarily because I dont like the tutorials even though that's part of it, but I dont like making games in general, seems boring lol, and the code is also confusing, in the sense of theres nothing really based on it. What to learn from this, nothing really, just how I feel. I dont really need to work on anything, IT'S A BREAK AND YOU arent working on anything >:(, like hansel said, dont overwork yourself, which is common knowledge tbh.  In more annoying news, BAKING WAS ANOTHER FAILURE EEEEEEE, I emailed trajan about it too xD, I'm not gonna feel bad/awkward about not doing enough, I kinda know what ben feels like now. I also dont know why I'm so centered around ukw, it's so weird, I need a therapist LOL. Mid terms on friday, philosophy reading is really something!!!   Examining the feeling, I kinda feel it in my lower chest. In hindsight I csnt really call it on command but I can still feel its residue. Damit feelings, what do you want from mee. Going back to process the information, I feel absolutelt.nothing eee, and I just feel dumb. Por dios ara. When it comes back I'll let.you know Xd   Handstands are still going pretty well tho. I'm hella neglecting my.legs :(. CARDIO TOMORROW

Hope I still remember how things work loll.

Update   Started reading 1 Corinthians because I was already familiar with what's happening in exodus and it's not really teaching me anything.  I still have that looming fear of returning to nigeria over me. It's so strange, it wasnt here before, and now its here, but as I didnt worry about it before and it didnt change my life, why should it change my life now.   But then one could say that I am just being ignorant Nd blinded by luxuries, I'm so grateful to God to be here in the first place, returning, I dont know why I make it sound like I'm returning to jail or sth. I'm just gonna  asleep and let tomorrow me handle this, at least more time home alone

Because I'm so privileged and content as to where I am today and if I were to go back to Nigeria, I dont know how I'll react to things :*). My mind has been zooming to what if something happens and we have to go back, or our visa expires >_<, I'll have to ask my dad about how he is looking to progress from here, but also I dont wNt to worry him and I know that God will provide for us, whatever happens.  Stressing only makes things worse! I am completely content with where I'm living now even though its not the best, and sure I could always do better, but compared to before, here is amazin, and I don't want to go back to before :(. The only viable option I see is the married to get visa thing or the job sponsorship :(.

    Entry: A bad Spanish day today. I feel very uncomfortable with my Spanish learning. I don't even know if what I'm writing is correct. It makes me feel bad :(. But, breathe deeply, I know that I have only developed my Spanish skills and haven't gone far backwards. I can't write like this anymore because it makes me think unnecessarily about what I am going to write, let alone what I want to say. Finally, I just want to say that I know that my Spanish is not perfect, and at the very least, I can form basic sentences, but I also know that I have read a lot of books and watched a lot of movies in Spanish, which means that I am improving my Spanish, and that just means that I just need to practice more, and I should make more mistakes, because that just means that I am learning even more. Anyways, I want to buy a pixel 6. I know! I shouldn't spend so much money on a phone, especially when my phone works pretty good. But it is a really cool phone and I want something new :(. I also noticed something! Some sentences are easy to form, while others are not. I know its vain ugh but I might get it. Also, I made some cookies today!!! They weren't that good. But they were so much better than the ones I made the day before yesterday. I practiced my handstands today and did some hiit cardio, I might hold off on working out tho, I'll just do handstands tomorrow And handstands and cardio on Friday as a rest. I really like my current physique too! I would like to develop my abs more tho. 5 more days until philosophy class starts

I kinda feel like the week is going by super quickly even though it really isnt. I havent gotten bored het tho >:)  Okay something I've been meaning to journal.a lot about, I've been thinking a lot Bout death. yeah IDK lol, its like when I'm in bed, i try to imagine what itd feel like if someone close to me died and I kinda guessed that itd be the same feeling as when I found out I was exposed to covid, but in a WAY BIGGER SCALE and idk how I'd handle it Nd my whole life would probably spiral out of control but THAT IS NOT HAPPENIN so I'm just enjoying what I have now.   Awayyy from that, having less and less frequent impending stress moments, for Christmas we are watching a movie and going to a buffet!! I'm not sure what the buffet is going to be like, but I'm happy to see what's gonna go on there. I might also order some cooking thingys for Christmas

I'll have to start by chatting with people who can correct me, yay.   Today ws pretty chill like I said, I started my handstand practice and lasted like 5 seconds off the wall :D. Then I went to do a hiit session after which was pretty nice. I think I've finished all I need to do for miaos job for the rest of the winter breaK!!!! All thsts left is to store the IT data to firebase, clean up code and some other stuff i can figure out later :)   I'm also still reading furycks saga and finished genesis yesterday.

First, tomorrow morning I would be getting data from the individuation training, it would be the best thing to focus on since I can continue to work on it over the break   Second, work on final for nart, study   Third, after finals, go to dr acevedo   Lastly, I already asked daniel if he knew how I could store the data. If he doesnt have an answer to that, I'd have to either find another way or talk to Dr. Mina, lol I said mina, miao.  Last, i can read the eurythros layer

    Entry: Concerning dr acevedo, I had a plagiarism issue blah blah..BUT THE THING IS I PLAGIARIZED MYSELF LOL.i know hes an understandable person though, so I'm not going to worry too much about it. If it comes to what I should do, he said I should just resubmit one of the essays, which I did. I should do others today?? Ugh idk what to focus on, I can either do the remaining two essays, and resubmit them. I think I'll do that know  For miao, I need to find a way to store the data ughh! I'll have to ask daniel ><. That is if I cant find a solution to this dilemma. Apart from that, I am close to being done. I have a plan to finish the IRBT before christmas and I can work on the IAT over the break - collecting data part   The thing is I have the winter break class XD, its gonna be pretty intense, its literally 2 weeks!!!! I'll survive tho. Inhale, and exhale   On a positive note, classes end tomorrow and narts final.will be done with!   Plan for the rest of today  - keep researching how to store data - finish other two essays  Edit   I decided that I wasn't gonna work on any other essay. If they give me a zero on the 3, it will be an 800 over 1000, which will be a b in a one credit class so eh. I doubt thay they wont be understanding though, so as long as I can clear things up with them tomorrow morning.  Concerning Miao, I jsut have to follow my plan sequentially

Now studying for nart, I think I have most of the basics down, in terms of the easystuff, when it comes to trig and the graphing stuff, that messes me up a bit ;-;, hmm what else   Had lunch for free again lol. I saw the dude! You know, the dude I wanna get to know, I should really talk to him, is this the first time this is happening, IDK I think so! He knows Allen,which means he might be a senior. Hmm  lost my nice pen :( but leia gave me one. I'm so whiny sometimes XD. I think I'm understanding most of the trigonometric identities tho  I've been watching lilly singh vlogs and howbtoncookthat, that's why I changed my mood to rad hehe. It's so nice to study in the library listening to lilly sonch- shes still so hella motivating!!! I should watch her videos whenever I feel worried lol. I dont want to make it seem like i worship her tho. Also that reminds me. I think my relationship with the bible and God has gotten better cause now the voice in my head guides me a lot more towards putting what I read to action. That aside, lilly singhs pretty great

Also programming final tomorrow which I'm not worried about. Still need to get in some last minute studying. Trying to plan on what I should learn next. I'm excited to start using vite! And the composition api. Once I'm done with this job. I'm gonna finish the course and use it for my next projects! :D I'm not really gonna think about SSR - server side rendering and I should just focus on what I'm doing now so that I can finish my job fairly well, and the semester can end properly. Hm forgot my train of thought loll. Gonna stick with what I'm doing now!   Concerning fitness, work on cardio and flexibility over the break as planned. Finish deload week, which will prolly be my last sessions in the gym ;*)  So that's for school and for gym. yes YES I N3ED TO LEARN BAKING LOOL. Baked a disaster today - failed cookies. Entirely my fault XD  That's about it. I'm gonna keep working on nart for tomorrow, and the IRBT. I feel like I'm forgetting something

Closer to my goal physique. Really!   Also the light is back! I spent my time readinggg, which was hella nice, and did some precalc studying. I'm not gonna work on the IRBT today, gonna ssave all that for mondayyy. I'm so happy with my current physique. But only you and I know how I look LOL. Over the winter break like I said.since I like my current muscle mass. I'm gonna be working on my cardio and flexibility. Yoga especially.  Also grio strength and handstand. Anyways it felt pretty good to disconnect. I should do it more often. I've made my current decision which I think I always knew. I love the bulky but not too big physique, big shoulders and wide chest, and all. Might seem vain but idk, I still love ma legs  UPDATE AT NIGHT   abojt to go to bed but had chinese food and worked a bit with files. I got nominated for a few awards, idk if I'd win lolll wish me luckkkk. My elbow hurts  ;-;!!! Might not lift heavy tomorrow  HA I JIST REALIZED ITS DELOAD WEEK. FLIPPING BRILLIANNT

I snuck into someoens house. Which was like a game we were playin,I was in the back of the chair and the person was talking bout the education system... which I. Think was inspired by the show I'm watching now loll. Then I got lost in the school. Found my way back. Richard was there, but he couldnt pronounce my name well lol. It was like a mix between UDM and some random place. My battery going down fast dang .  Cyaa

Physically too. ALSO not looking forward to the coding club call ugh, maybe I should say I cAnt come. Blegh.   Havent watched more of the vue tutorials but I already decides I'm saving that for break. ben IS STRONG. DUDE lifts 315lbs on deadlifts!! Goals lolll. Look at me being all jealous XD, tbh it's not the bad kind of jealous I dont think, it's a weird feeling, like it's in my chest...or that's just a lack of cardio lolll. I didnt feel happy when he didnt mKe 405lbs, so maybe it's something I'd have to work on :D. Developing the friendly rival competition spiritt!   Super thirsty rn XD, I lifted 230s on squats today! :D, the bar on my back feels practically weightless at this point.  News bloopers are super funny, apparently a freudian slip is a thing. I really didnt feel motivated to work on the IRBT even though I got quite a bit done. It feels eh, most of my code is repetitive and I hope the composition api can help once I learn how to use it! Learning how to use stuff on vue gets me excitedddd ngl  :P.   Back to ben, he has a certain way about it, like he shines light to people's accomplishments Nd deduces things about that. It's not a bad thing at all, just noticed it. I wanna hang out with him more, welp too late for that :p   I dont wanna do this kinda work, I'd rather make some hella bomb visual website, tbh speaking like this makes me feel like more of a designer than a logics person, idk XD. Boutta keep reading psalms, I cant think of...I saw ablue Jay in academics writing class haha!! Glasses ftww. Birds put a smile on my face :)  Ugh thinking of precalc I ness to study FOR THE finals ugjnughnguhnguhnguhm. Me losing my vitality right there, I think I have a grasp of what hes going over. But ehhh. I still have  long ways to go in the study guide. Maybe when I settle down tomorrow I can work on it along with watching avatar. Ugh I wish I was home alone all weekend

I finally stopped procrastinating and booked my writing centr time!! I'm also outside in the cold studying for narts work. It's so peaceful. Except the cars lol. Almost no one around and have been watching how to cook that videos. I should continue watching lilly sonchs vlogs lolll. Havent worked on my job code today,   Gonna start the irbt sometime next week or over the weekend. I'm not looking forward to the coding club call ugh

    Entry: I'm just gonna say today was pretty rad in a sense. I got my YAC video done :D. The impromptu speech went great and I got a 100 :D. Also I dont really have to go to skewl tomorrow but I'm still gonna. I'm probably gonna spend most of my time in the library which means that I'm either going to be very productive or laze around. Or both, maybe some chill coding for the IRBT with simpsons. Sounds great, still need to present the demo from our assignment 3 tomorrow.   I talked finally in the ecology server again :D. I've been there for more than a year I realize hahaa. How the time has passed by. I'm also finding myself have a strange habit of reordering my tabs constantly as a way to seek order in the chaos which is my brain. It really helps me remember what I need to do though.  I AM GOING TO THE WRITING CENTER TOMORROW IF THAT IS THE LAST THING I DO. I need to stop procrastinating. I actually think I'm gonna focus on precalc while taking a break on the IRBT. Nart gave a study guide that I need to look over!!!.   Hmmm, i didnt resist tempt. Twice!!!! So I deleted reddit, and need to find ways to block my browser, if I'm not gonna be able to stop myself, I'll dam well for it. Tomorrow is upper day, probably gonna see ben in the lib. Hmmmmm, what else. I think that's it. I've been finding more time to journal and do duolingo lately but I still need to improve my Spanish, it's at a bit of a standstill rn as I'm still reading furycks saga, BUT I'm gonna re read rojo blamco y azul, so I'm gonna send it to my kindle now. WHICH REMINDS ME MY KINDLE STOPPED WORKING some time last week and it shook me up lol

    Entry: Been working on academic writing paper. alSO first I need to make the video I need tomorrow ( for YAC UGH ) but, but, but but but, the Kapor center call. Someone joined and started sending some weird stuff!@@ SOME very weird stuff loll. Kinda messed up the mood a bit but I finally finished it ughh yessss. Now I'm thinking about my physique goals. Idk whether I'd like a bulky physique, tbh I like being bulky, without looking fat ;-;  Also lifted with ben and felt pretty good on deadlifts. Finally reached 205lbs :D. Gonna reach 225 before the end of this semester!!!!   Okay so I'm trying to plan on the rest of my week and how I'm gonna make things work. I can spin off, now I realize thatd be lying. What I was planning is that since its finals weeks, or basically finals week, my progress is going to be quite slow. Yeah no just decided against that. I wanna keep learning vue! Specifically the composition api cause its gonna be a new way of setting up projects that I may enjoy using. Another thing is that I still need to catch up on vue 3s features. I can keep watching the vue videos I have on udemy for that!!! Maximillian would really help and I know that . The time commitment would be the issue. I'd have.to study for nart, I'm planning on doing that later in the day, in the mornings, I can work on my.job, go to class. After that, either keep working more on job, which will help me get things done faster, but right now, I need to prioritize precalc, so I'll do that. Precalc goes first! Also have impromptu speech hehe. I'm planning on going to writing center after speech class. Which I think will be the best because I'm gomma.procrastinate and speaking of procrastination lol. I need to do ghe YC video, I'm gonna do iti. Andre's dorm tomorrow. iT WILL BE DONE TOMORROW, MARK My WORDS  So lets make a list of what we need shall we  - Study for precalc - Make YC video  - Go to writing center  - Work on job  - Work on vue ( optional as I can put this off till the break ), which I think is what I'll do. Or to after finals ag least. Need to focus on job and school, while vue can be put on the backburner...UNITY on the other hand, bleh

    Entry: Feeling a bit worried about tomorrows call. Today's call went well and for the secret Santa party, things actualllly went pretty well! We played mafia with cards and it was fun XD. Got my roblox gift card.   My younger brother said school got let out early yesterday, its really strange and with all the news going around, it feels pretty weird. They do have testing tomorrow but it's still kinda strange. He also said that someone has been talking about shooting up the school which is so strange. I do believe that the school officials, especially miss Tillman will know enough not to put the students in danger. They will also have heard something. All in God's hand.   Did pretty well on precalc quiz! Nd need to study for the final >_<. I also noticed I've been quite busy. I spend the majority of my free time in the library coding for my job. Then after last class, 1, I go to gime. Speaking of which, I saw ben there, he complimented my chest strength 🌟🌟🌟😭🌟😭🌟😭🌟😭, he said he didnt know that I took lifting seriously haha.  I'd love to talk to him more about lifting.  My heart still feels disturbed at the school news, mostly because it's so plausible given the history of central and the students in it. Everything will turn out well, don't worry. I wonder if anyone else reads these :[]. Did some more reading on furycks saga, and I'm really happy with my academic writing paper.   I still haven't been resisting temptation and I feel like I have no real drive to better myself in a sense, it's something I'd have to really go over with myself  ;-;. What more hmm,   Almost the end of the year, what should I reflect on, what I've learned I guess   - Worrying solves nothing, who can add an hour to their life by worrying   Hahah reminds me, for speech class we have impromptu speeches on wednesday and I'm excitedddd. Anyways   - Yeah don't worry   - Do and learn stuff!!! Best to rack up experience and stories than to live as a square   - Keep journaling, it makes you feel better :D, csnt wait for my 600 day streak  - Keep reading, both the bible and fiction. Best to be spiritually strong   -Dont attach unnecessary weight to unnecessary things!!  - Relax, and that's about it.  I'm about to brush my teeth, which I still dont like doing!

    Entry: Being a while since I felt this feeling. So kalisha emailed about the cs ed week and it's at 6 30, which I'm not sure I'll be home then. It's kinda like a worry for the uncertainty of the future. Anyways I know better than to worry about things and whatever happens will happen. He usually comes around 6 - 6:15 and it starts at 6:30 with 5 minute introduction. I have time unless he comes at like 7, which I still have time! Cause I can do it in school. Richard also gave me a head sup that someone might be emailing me about some JOURNI company thingy  This morning, I also felt jumpy/hazy, like really hazy, in the beginning at least. It got slightly better though. That's mostly the bad part tho!  Dr barry complimented my essay draft! And dr nart is actually a pretty great teacher. We have the precalc test tomorrow. God give me the strength. Speaking of which, i feel like the link is getting thinner and I no longer have the words of the bible in the back of my mind usually. Hopefully this changes with time. I should add overcast with activities. Also found a great word today, gnossiene. Also dr mina said my lab quiz was excellent :D  Also talked with sean and ranted about simpsoms, hes a pretty cool person. Enough with the negativity, ending with a happy heart, i got breakfast for free!!! Cause my id wasnt working, my lab quiz was great, I found some joggers to wear haha, my workout was pretty good. Shoulder press thoooo, I no longer have a speech to worry about ;D. I have somewhere to sleep. My life is pretty good. Also got a new phone case and a flash drive. I'll prolly either give the flash drive to Andre or buy something else. My call with dr miao was rescheduled and right now, all I need to focus on is the IRBT, storing data to excel or pushing to firebase, andddd that's it.  That's all for now tho. Ending things positively

    My mood bad
    
    Entry: I dont really feel like journaling. I'm only sure why I feel bad, just kinda do rn. Mostly thinking of andre and his backstory which I still have absolutely no idea what his family was like. I imagine parents split up/fought but I'm not jumping into any conclusions. I also didnt feel any envy about him getting the ford position, maybe because it was a guarantee? I dont knoowww.   We had the lab quiz for intro to prog today and  it went really well. The more I talk with ben the more it seems like I'm overestimating my position. Ben has really great potential to be someone who can code great things, he just needs to overcome this first barrier of thinking in terms of code.   I started reading psalms and furycks saga, and I was able to complete ( at least I HOPE the irbt section of my job ). Idk if I should add more hours!!! And just say i focused on the irbt?? Do you think i should.  Lying is a sin, yes. However, it would be compensating for the time I spent over the break, which was more of volunteer tbh. If I say I focused on irbt, it would free time to work on the iat. FRIck I realized I made a mistake, I've been working on the individuation training, not the IRBT and I got the two confused. I'll figure out what to do tomorrow. It's easier to understand working on the IT first. So I'll do that, yeah.   All in all, had speech today and only Andre, nadeya and nadia were in class. Andre, so much sadness in his eyes, maybe his upbeat attitude Is a way to compensate, which isnt a bad thing.   I miss yoga

Was okay but after that, I felt pretty hazy, so then I lifted, been getting stronger!!! Felt really strong on the row!! And might reach 200lbs on deadlifts :D! So after that, hanged out with Andre and Aaron, also adasa and I'm just realizing all a s lol. There was a school shooting somewhere in Michigan and it makes me wonder why people do the things they do .and then its going to be forgotten in about a month without anyone really doing anything more about the issue till the next one!  It's a real doozy. Didnt really do any reading today cause we finally finished the programming project! And went to eden with nyny haha.   All in alll a pretty meh day

I got a bit worried cause I told dr Miao that I was undocumented but I realized that theres nothing to worry about. I'm just thinking that someone will barge in here XD. She said she'll talk to finance people and they work with undocumented students AND cant get access to my things etc so I need go learn not to get surges of worry. I really enjoy tje chatter while in the toilette when its snowing slash raining outside on a Sunday

    Entry: Was so bored this morning!! And felt a bit of overcast. It's a bit bette.r also I think I got the job! Idk dont ask me!! Okay.so the part I am confused about is whether I am redesigning the entire site. I'll have to ask her that! Also the timing over the break ee. Also need to talk to her about my immigration status ugh. I'll have to email her, note to self, email her about nature of the job. Hmmm idk how i feel. Sometimes I feel excited because I know what to do and how to do it and shes not really.bothered with the code. But I also feel like I'm going to get a buncha new challenges and have to start thinking and worrying about a bunch of stuffs that would make my break less interesting. "Break". Also I feel like I'm not qualified and the immigration status would just make everything a hassle for everyone. So what I think I'll do, is just email her about the nature of the job and whether I'm redesigning the entire site. If I am, it's not going to be bad at all. Imma also talk to her about the excel sheet thing. If I'm redesigning the entire site, I'd be super happy. If not, I dont think I'd wanna work on the project they have now blech.

I spent 20 mins on the exercise bike watching southpark. I've finished dr minas work. We had the test today! And I hope Andre did well. I think I did pretty well!, for the most part. Hmm what else, furycks saga is getting pretty intense again. I stopped the Spanish boooook :*(((. I should alternate! It would be good that way. When I'm coming I'll read spanish till I get tired, I wonder how that's turn out. I hope my mum goes to work tomorrow!! Lso I need to practice some more unity!!! I'm at player animations.

I think I have figured out how to do the job assignment and I really just need to work on the accuracy now. I felt overwhelmed for a while but asked God for strength ( co reliance in a way). Also watched the Simpson which is a joy as usual. Cold weather yasss. It was more than cold, it was cloudyyyy. So after spending most of the early morning trying to work on it and feeling brain flucked, I figured it mostly out. Working with the code however can be a bit tricky. What more, jaxbladd with his mentally mature videos being a joy as usual. I'm getting tired slash frustrated with alegs, he reminds me of ariez  ;-;.  X also acts strange online ugh. However about me. What's up with me today I miss yogaaaaa and meditating in a calm fashion. I havent felt savasana cloudy day clear in a while. However I've really seen the changes in my physique! Roblox is down LOL but back to yoga. I wonder how I can get into practice again! I've also been feeling a bit let down with sky cause now j have 0 candols and the satisfaction of playing is dying out I'm bputta brush my teeth but I couldnt handle losing my duolingo streak lol. Till I finish furycks saga, and start a spanish book, I have to keep going.

    Entry on 2021-10-24
    My mood Happyish
    
    Entry: Found this awesome js library called puppeteer where its basically web scraping or automating on websites which is pretty cool!! The evaluate function is used to do js on the site I'm just saying that now XD. There is a lott to learn and I don't really need to learn everything now or even everything at all. When the need arises to do sth I can use it to do it and I'm not gonna beat myself up for not trying to memorize it all. Speaking of which. I had that memorizing dilemma thingy and just realized that I don't need to memorize!!@ as long as I know where the docs is and can understand what the thingys are being used for. Anyways I'm off to play spark   Edit  O dear, I was jsut watching a video on revelations and then I realized that if death is like sleeping. And with sleep, time doesn't really matter as you can wake up the next day while only thinking a span of minutes or even no time passed. So with death. Thousands of years can pass. And then once the word of revelations come to pass. Everyone will be awakened and idk why but it makes me feel actually I know why, it makes me feel really scared because it's easier to ignore religion than follow it and then come up with reasons as to why not to listen! And just with every other thing I feel overwhelmed but I think CRU is a pretty good place to start, I have my meeting with Nate by 12 which is lunch time ee, maybe I'll ask if we can have lunch, but if not. Then flup. But maybe now I have to really start paying attention to the bible_/doing good  Edit   It's kinda a mind boggling existential crisis. It's so fun to believe that it's not gonna happen and live in the blissful ignorance of it all but now we know better. I'm gonna have to start slow? I dont really know which way to go :(. Its like I need to believe that Jesus died for our sins. And I  don't know exactly what to make of it. Like. I'm not even sure how believing works anymore. I'm gonna have to start attending more of the meetings!! Sooo how does one start believing. Good question. I cant repeat it in my head again and again till I know it's true. And I do know the bible can serve as guidance so maybe I should start reading the bible/set time out of the day to read which I know is gonna be really helpful but I'm still unsure about whether I'm gonna get the answers I want soon enough. Now the idea of where the consciousness goes after death doesnt seem so far fetched for me. Like time doesn't apply when sleeping. It may occur all around, but not inside. And then theres the thing of people saying it's all a fairy tale but there is proof that it happened and that Jesus existed. So my first step is going to believe in Jesus...and how exactly do I do that..

I might look into web scraping and seeing how spotify works but I've been hoping to get into a new project. Idk why but I start feeling bored when I'm not working on a coding project which has been in a while. Idk if it's in the fear of forgetting what I know. Or it just challenges me and i kinda enjoy it 🤔 I really wanna learn new things that can make ma life easier ( well, not easier but more convenient lol ). I'll start thinking of either a practical project. Mini project I can do before starting the ecommerce site ( while learning unity, which I think is going really well but it's mostly memorizing as the tutorial is off YouTube and not somewhere substantial ). OH and I almost finished academic writing paper, which I am happy about!! Hm maybe my next project will be something fitness related. I was going to say imma start tracking mt workout with the app but then nahhhhhh its gonna take a lotta work in terms of exercises blah blah. I think my next new skill is going to be web scraping. I'm just hoping for daniel to get back to me

Ughhh my brain is just wrong >:(. Since I know itll make me feel better. Tbh I already feel better but I was having an issue with the c++ code, and he was like he did his quite easily, my issue was just like when I put text it gets into an endless loop. Another thing was that he was able to basically automate one discord bot thing and I thought it was really cool how functional it was and I started feeling like my coding knowledge is impractical and pointless UGHHH. Its good I'm letting it out here. RICHARD SAIDNI CAN WORK AT JOURNI NEXT SUMMER THO so that was super awesome. Joy hasnt still responded grr. I'll still email her >:*(. Hmmmm what else. Tomorrow I'll email her. So basically I feel like my coding knowledge is for trivial things that I wont use in my day to day life but actually that's a lie and I've used what I know when browsing numerous times. Also lesening is great in general! I'm learning unity rn and learned about InputKey.getCode(frick I forgot what was supposed to enter here)!!!! I'll have to look it over. The tutorial is no way substantial so I'm mostly going off memorization rn. Its really late but I'm going to keep going on. I've been able to learn html css js vue, all of which with their issues and hurdles, and I'm currently learning unity and trying to build an ecommerce site, which design is frustrating as I havent crossed over the basic barrier yet. Hmm what else. Ian said I looked good in ma glasses lol. Furycks saga is getting intense!!!! And I had a really good leg workout. Got 205 for 5 on squats!!! I'm gonna still have to aim higher to reach ben, grr. I think that's basically all. I have precalc quiz on monday and have to write academic writing paper in a week. Hmmmm. I've still being feeling quite rotund but I'm not even going to pay it any mind, I know my tendencies. Itd be so cool to have zoom vision lol

    Entry: I REALLY MISS THE GYM and the bodyweight workout today was okay but starting it made me feel like I was back in quarantine and I didn't like the feeling. Anyways thsts not why I'm journaling now. Also I can see a lot why people got messed up during the pandemic. After spending most of my time in school, just 4 days was enough to make me start feeling weird an md overeating mostly out of nothing really to eat, but I'm not going to complain because a lotta people have it worse. And I'm not gonna make myself feel bad for complaining. Anyways I had a dream that I was on a table in vicsum I think but also with abiola from mind builders, and it kinda got me feeling strange. Idk if they remember me or randomly think about me. Like i really do think about them for like. Once or twice every two weeks. But it stil makes me feel icky. Like abiola was born into a rich situation and Adeniyi is in London right now and I dont know how i feel about it, which is really strange I know. Future me reading this, any ideas? Emotions are strange indeed. Hmm what more, it's getting colder and I really cant wait for christmas. Also maybe I'm letting nostalgia get the best of me. I know dang well, actually, now I dont know whether I really liked them or not. Subomi was super cool to hang out with but I know I was also a money digger kind of. And then theres Michael, even adeniyi. We got on good terms with each other which was awesome. My spanish learning is severely halting. I hope I'll be able to take a Spanish class next year, I'm gonna have to read my next book in soanish but that could take weeks. Either I start now, and download a book, halting furycks saga, and read something else. But then reading is my sanctuary in a sense. Hmmmm, I really dont wanna think about it rn but j also wanna get back into practice ;-;. I'll give myself, sort of a break, not break but a pass as to not to feel bad about this. I know practicing and practicing will get me good but online things like texting wouldnt favor me at all. I know that. Anyways I'm feeling better but still feel icky about my relationship with the past. Like sometimes I get another really strange feeling, like something bad has happened randomly whenever I think about the past. I'm gonna have to find a way to name these feelings. Also idk whether this is useful but I'm grateful for being able to play south park, that I'm able to cook and eat when I'm hungry, Nd for the LOVELY weather!! Hm, that made me really notice the things I'm grateful for. Maybe I'll make this a habit

I also signed up for another for the end of the month, am I looking forward to it, maybe. I'm really worried I have no good ideas which is a bummer and it started to overwhelm me a lot. I'm also going to be working solo cause I know the only expectations I'd have would be for myself. I'm still.happy theres no school today tho. South parks working again XD. Okay my mind is a bit clear now. Plan of action, for this hackathon I'm going to do one challenge every day. Maybe more depending on how I feel. Then fof the hacknitr, I will be working alone and I have 17 days to come up with a plan or app that I wanna work on. I think I'll also use python as a way to start practicing. I might use python and or svelte for all upcoming projects tbh,

Hmmm what else. My mum found out about the new laptop and she was her usual annoying self IGH and the annoying thing is that I had a gym  - side gym instead of dream cause I'm watching how heavy are the dumbbells you lift XD - about her that reminded me of Eadmunds dream in furycks saga. Anyways, she was asking about it and I was like now that you know, what does it change. And it was just so much filler that I've heard before that I've basically forgotten about it now. I also decided to just stare into her eyes once she said I should drop my phone and I think it disarmed her for a sec cause I could kinda see her nervousness. Also I freaking love the simpsons, ive been watching episodes I havent caught up on and it's so funny, same with how heavy are the dumbbells you lift. Also a police chase outside with someone on a motorcycle XD. I'm gonna have to finish academic writing paper and the elementary functions quiz. I downloaded the south part full game and it's so fun so far. This is prolly the longest journal today. Hmm no school Monday or tuesday so I'm gonna do yoga or bodyweight then. Cardio will be good, I think I'll do pull day cause I wanna practice deadlifts. Woke up way too early too ;-;

I feel jealous :( but blah blah insert motivational speech. I'm tired of being jealous of people so I'm trying just to feel happy for them now. I'm considering taking a break from the coding club to focus on python and I'm trying not to focus too much on where the course will take me

    Entry: Feeling quite a bit better, I realized that since I like ish finding patterns and python is really popular and I can see so many applications, I'm gonna learn python for data analysis, so I'd have to pay attention to stats class. Data analysis sounds pretty fun tbh and it can really help the real world

    My mood Meh
    
    Entry: I don't wanna overstate my mood so I'm choosing to go with Meh. The thing is I talked with Ethans brother today who's an ecologist or studying ecology inna sense. And its pretty cool what hes working on in terms of developments that have an actual implementation in helping people get better lives or improving things. So now where my crisis ish thingy comes in is that he mentioned  in a sense how learning cs and then ending up working at a tech firm is a waste of intellectual knowledge in a sense and that youre not really doing anything to contribute to physical society which I 2000% agree with and managed to shove the thought down my head and focus on cs. So now making websites just seems so, so pointless as it neither really helps me nor the people around me . And then theres technology like c++ that I'm not really a fan of. Mostly cause I've not seen first hand what it can do.  And because of that, I'm not really interested in learning it ughhh. So now with the knowledge I have, I don't know how I'll be able to tie it in with sustainability which is something I'd really love to do!!!! And like the actual research. On the other hand I can focus on data and data based languages but that seems very specific and in a sense, notnwhere my life seems to be headed ugh. This is another point in my life where I'd need to make a decision and I need to really think about this. Theres nothing more I'd love than to find a way to use technology to encourage sustainability or help the biodiversity of a certain place, so listing out my choices, I have   - keep working on Vue.js and website building.  It's still a really good skill and companies need people to do it   - Start focusing on c++ or python. I'd choose python cause of how much I've heard about it, and then focus on that as a main language to work on data or statistics related issue   - give up on all of it and focus on ecology, which is the least plausible option :/  I'll have to brood over this for a few days. I can buy or ask daniel, speakingnof which. I still am not interested in game design and that's set in my mind right now. Ethans brothers talk was really brain opening for me and caused a lotta internal conflict which I'm letting out now. But then wheres the job market for statistics in the engineering field without focusing on a language like R or GIS that specifically deals with statistics or gathering data. Even though the job market might not be big, it might still be a valuable skill to have but eventually I'd need to focus on the path I want to take. I really enjoy front end development and seeing a site come together, but it feels like a waste of intellectual juice and not impacting society in a positive way ;/. Well not positive but in a tangible way. If I decide to learn python today, I can become good at it and eventually start working with data and machine learning, etc. However if I stick with vue, I can be proficient in it and keep learning and being better. I'll have to brood over this like I said. On to other things. Classes are goin pretty well, and tbh I'm not really in a mood to journal more

    Entry: Downloading and started continuing furycks saga. Its pretty interesting! Also wanted to redownload sangre azul bla bla. Jared texted me and hes really a different person online XD. Today might, just might be the day where I stop using duolingo and start reading spanish books instead. Actually, I think once I'm done with furycks saga, I'll start reading exclusively spanish books! I saw a super cool internship but it required a work permit ;-;. Its such a bummer. My workout today wasnt good, there is no lat pulldown machine ;-;, hm I heard a bird Haha, but anyways, that combined with the front desk taking my bag and not knowing how to properly do one arm rows turned out to not be the best workoit :*). I also wasnt sore from yesterdays workout and it made me feel really bad even though soreness doesn't mean growth :(. I dong expect to be sore tomorrow and know I wont be. I have no speech clas tmmw which is kinda a load off. I have to finish up the commentary for dr Barry and also the homework for dr shawash. It's so confusing and at this point I just flat out gave up on it. I left my headphones in Andre's room 😭😭, big oof. OH and I bought a pass for Exa!! Super fun 🤣. Joy texted me about wanting to make a student profile for me which is really interesting. Personally I think I'm boring but whatever she sees 🤷‍♂️. I also worked and made quite a bit of progress on the windows 11 page.a lot kinda happened today

I did try to teach him some good form tho. My speech is tomorrow and I have ma clothes ready, but pimples showed up on my face 🤣 at the perfect time :*) anyways this makes me feel really good, idk why, just put all my stresses on paper. I'd still love to show daniel my new portfolio tho but nows not the time, I wanna finish working on ma windows site, havent had the time to focus on it. Oh another thing is that idk if I wanna learn unity or not, if just doesnt call to me like three js. Anyways slime part 2 is FRACKING AWESOME!!@ I'm a sucker for slice of life's but the animation and action is just. Chefs kiss. I hope I do well on E.Ms quiz tomorrow and my knowledge doesnt fail me. Also I hope I'm able to get ma glasses or at least eye checked this or early next month. Hm what else. I'm kinda in my head quite a bit but I know to just stay in the present and do what I can. I'm always like my skill is wasting away slowly oh nooo, XD which I know is kinda dumb but it's still good for me to set up a routine and I'm not gonna kick myself cause of it. Csnt wait to start new program thooo, I have a goal physique and I wanna look like the person there. I know my goals will eventually change ( looking at you future me ) but still, :D onward!! A spider just tried to drop on me 🤣🤣, very sus. I've yawned a bit less but I realize I yawn more when my brother is around, not sure what for. Anyways I'm not gonna dawdle on stuff.

Still reading BLS and had a really great session today tbh but my.lower back man, I dropped down weight in squat to practice  bit more. Overhead press was good except left shoulder acting weird. And today started out super weird with the blue paint thing where I messed up towels with paint and my mum just being an honest pain in the soul. I also look such a random second to appreciate nature and sight when seeing how clear things are. Still need glasses gho. I might stop doing duolingonsoon as I really need to actually practice my Spanish or maybe learn a new language. Udemy gave out some coffee courses yesterday. Tomorrows the weekend and I submitted my final paper, I just need to work on 30 second video, also submitted resume, doing some questions for elementary functions quiz and working on outline. I felt super drowsy tho and tbh ate so much at tdr that I am still full. Also female goldfinch attached. I should catch up with the wildlife buddies soon!!!

I need to work on my form for squatting which is why I feel down. Not only squatting tbh but also bench press. Its making me consider starting a new program altogether :(. Ughj maybe it's because I'm progressing too fast and didnt spend enough time on form. Okay so new plan. For the rest of the month I'm going to focus in getting my form down so lifting 35s both sides on the squat. Same with bench press at 105 for total. Same with other lifts to be honest. I'm gonna stick to this :*) it's better to progress well knowing have good form, than progressing badly and getting an injury. I shouldve spent more time working on my form but doing this now wi help me in the long term

Added new books to kindle and it's a pretty gloomy day but its chilly which I loveee. Ms Johnson also sent over a plaque and a letter ;D  Edit  Looking back at my journals, I've changed so much. From November 2020, I've seen that I really did enjoy learning about ecology but now, I found that I actually like coding. Specifically the design and building part. My goals are no longer to help the environment but maybe just to build cool stuff with tech. Maybe my love for Ecology will be reignited. I havent been on the server in a long while but even in  terms of my physical life. I've seriously improved and not let how I look ruin my day, or place too much emphasis on overeating. I dont want to blame things on fasting tho. Maybe lifting does give a confidence boost..and a haircut. My mums going to Washington tomorrow. Hope she has a good trip. Might have to start reading at home though. :(. So I've grown physically, emotionally and job focus ically in the last year. I might read some more about past me

    Entry: Okay so I just got a moment of worrying about school. Ugh I dont like the feeling but I'm managing to calm myself down. School just started, I dont need to be worrying about dropping below a 3.0 right now. I think its because of the tti survey thing and the fact that I dont know how I'm doing cause no grades have been put in yet. Especially that fact to be honest because I think that since no grade has been put in, all the grades I get need to be great. Also the issue that idk how my quizzes or tests are going to result. I've been studying for the math quiz and I emailed dr shawash about office hours. So let's look at the facts. I'm just going to focus on doing the best I can at this point. Worrying over the future is pointless and my studying wont fail me   Edit   Office hour booked for 12. Got a haircut and my hair is tiny now ;-; started imperfectly criminal and I'm feeling quite a bit better about college classes. I just need to keep my head up in these first weeks

If you're worrying about whether youd remember what you're learning. Just practice, you have 5 days!!! For 4 chapters, you can learn a lot in that time  For speech class, dont worry too much about things. Think of it as a conversation, dont make your voice sound weird. Imagine everyone is Andre and it's just both of you  For academic writing, you already have notes prepped oitnfor next class session  Stop worrying about your GPA in the first week!!!!!!!  Stay in the present and do the best you can do :)   I think thays all my worries. For speech quiz. That's the past and nowni know what to look out for in the next quizzes. Cya now. This is your first week of college. THIS  IS YOUR FIRST WEEK OF COLLEGE

Just another learning experience. *Pats self* also worrying about it wont change it so best to keep movingnforward  Okay so update  I've been worrying about whether I'm going to succeed in college, mostly worrying about the future of things.

I then found out another section of the gym!!! It has a buncha equipment's and just like kenichis masters said, my training didnt fail me. Headdtands and three hand stands were easy!! I did two pullups LOL but I did pullups finally hahaha, I didnt know I could do one. And jump roped, it was fun to have andre there 🤣. It also gave me a teensy tiny ego boost hehe. He was surprised by hoe athletic I was at least and asked whether I've been working out. He still does the running a mile thing but imma get him lifting >:) I still feel like I have a small frame but OMG JUST SAW A NORTHERN CARDINAL HAHAHA, mid flight, back to my talk, I might have a small frame around others but it makes me feel light and flexible!!!! So I'm not gonna be ashamed of it anymore >:D. I told fundamentals of speech class that I was turning 16 which made me feel bad after but what's being done done being done. I have a few work to do but its okay man. I might also consider telling my.parents about ma need for glasses!

Sometimes it's cool to have my accent cause others notice but then again, it can be hard to understand what I say :(. I also said I wouldnt do things that I dont feel like and I think I held true to myself on that, I didnt unnecessarily say something I didnt want to say, and I also relaxed and just stayed on my phone when I didnt want to talk or wasnt interested so I'm proud of myself for that at least :D  The reason for the picture is that I was talking to handle about trash people hahah, also yesterday I didnt really feel like writing much, I'm pretty excited for classes and gomma get everything ready tomarrow. I might do a yoga session today cause we just played volleyball  Also recently I've been VERY interested in what others thought of me, idk why really. I just try to imagine myself "from the outside looking in" ( hehe shoulder charge reference" ). And like I dont know whether I'm too quiet or say unimportant things. I got this psychology book that I'm combating on reading instead of spanish book but I think I'm going to split my time wit the book, just to help me read people better. I'm not sure what to tell myself though. Its just so complicated, I wanna be cool in other people's eyes, which sounds weird but it's true, at the end of the day I just need to be more comfortable with myself and do things that the real me woild do. Very cringy I know Lol. :>) I'm just never going to be able to read other people's mind and accept that people may or may not like me  and irs their choice to do so or not

    Entry: Realizing I have an addiction, I'm gonna start actively trying to stop it. I also fell into an old mindset of me becoming fatter just because I dont have abs that show visibly which I know is really dumb and will get me nowhere so in the memory of not dawdling on issues. I got over it. I'm also SUPER EXCITED ABOJT MY SITE CAUSE IT LOOKS SO GOOD AHHAHAHA IM EXCITED ABOUT IT :D. I USED spline to make a 3d rendering thingy, which was what I had in mind. So I made a branch on github. Learned spline starting today, ( it was on the back burner for so long and I dony know why but I just picked it up and I love it!!! ). Araoladipo.tech man's. I also chatted with hansel and alegs which has been super fun. Oh oh and I started watching this anime called kenichi, it was in an attempt to actively look for a way to motivate myself to workout harder but the thing is, I think I've built pretty solid discipline over the years dont ya think ;). I still workout enough and know when I'm not pushing myself enough and when to back down so that training doesnt become a chore :D. Martial arts/boxing is starting to entice me tho. Hopefully udms gym has a punching bag oooooo. I think kenichis rubbing off on me hehe. Wouldnt have been possible if hansel hadn't recommended genoanime. I'm gonna try not to put myself down, which I've been doing well at. And gonna focus on good decisions, like eating less spaghetti tonight. Even though it was an hella oily meal

    Entry: Okay so today I've been feeling conflicted. Mostly about finding internships but ultimately I decided itd be best to focus on sharpening my skills and not worrying about whether or not I'd get an internship. I think I got stung by a bee, eee. And I'm getting my vaccine and tb test on Monday 👁👄👁💧. Wish me luck    Even though journaling seems mundane, it really has helped me a lot. Especially since when I get threatened "", or I feel conflicted, whenever I try to positively reaffirm myself, I feel like it just stays in my short term memory. Then I have to keep restating it to myself in a cycle of reaffirmation and it's not the best feeling..writing things down helps keep my reaffirmation in a solid place that I can look back upon and always know it's going to be there, since it's like writing notes instead of trying to keep info in my head. Whenever I feel like this - conflicted - I'll do my best to write more! Also a professor, the one filling in for dr bani taan :( sent an email and class is going to be about c++ so I'm doing some pre studying to at least get ahead

It ties magic and watches in a weird way, I'm not sure I like it but It was a fun read, not a lotta suspense though. Also finished final project for google cssi!! I'm still gonna use the design from the sits but I'm gonna tweak things to make them better. OH OH I had the interview 2 today with harder questions. The interviewer asked questions about big O complexity and I got it :D, he was a cool guy and I was able to solve the two questions quite well :) and then worked out after. It was an hella intense workout. Home now tho, I'm still gonna keep trying to style things up on ubuntu

I have the design but imma take a break. Still reading dragonsblood boook 4 but the zooming thing makes it hard to read :(. I was worrying g about whether I'd get a job at google...at freaking 15 years old.....u dumb lolll, I need to stop overthinking or analyzing things and just let things flow. I wanna get really good with vue but I'm still not yet ready for taking the course. I came across a easy ish js problem that I couldnt figure out and it kinda stressed me but I got it now ,also I think itll be good for me to form a relationship with Chris at least I'd know more people in more places....ummmmm what else  Havent done full Alex's module session in a while :(, I'm also writing the thank you letter to donor rn, planning on finisjing it tomarrrrowwwww, I also was stressing about my conversation skills yesterday but I think it's pretty okay :). I might read the javascript algorithms book/take a course on it but book would be better to start imo, just to get basic knowledge. I know I'll learn them as I go tho so I'm not gonna stress too much about it but maybe I should think about using python for it instead of javascript just cause theres more resources and it seems like a backendthing, I'll dwell on it,

Then what'd the form used for, why did they send the form UGHHHHHHH ITS SO ANNOYING nd THAT IS WHY I NEVER WANNA OPEN UP TO HER. Also  caught her looking at me laptop 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀. Javascript the good parts is an okay book, I have learned quite a bit and the parts I skipped are really really confusing. I have 20 percent ledt... then its dragonsblood >:) some whole drama went on with jolin today. Idk why people ask for help but arrnt willing to heed the advice they receive, Same with sushi. It's hard being emotionally available for someone and I don't think it makes the person needing it a bad person, but it does kinds make them inconsiderate. Idk about the other POV tho

I'm getting better at not being threatened by someone else's success and focusing on my own. I've also noticed my pretty great skill improvement when it comes to web dev over the years and even months which makes me really happy :). We also visited an urban garden today which was a fun experience! I'd love to be able to garden in my future house. Now I also feel paranoid that someone's reading this so imma set up some more defenses on my phone hehe. I havent practiced a lotta spamish lately tho, I've been a teensy bit busy, not too busy to stress me though. I'm still working on the manifest site and I really wanna be done with it quickly. I wanna start learning three.js, ths only thing is that the market for three js isnt big as far as I know so I'll look up what web developers are learning, actually no. I'm going to keep getting better and more proficient at vue and javascript nd the other things will come in their time. Right now I'm almost really done with my anime search site, I do need to rework the news section though, but I've also worked on responsiveness! Yay me :)

Anyways, hm imma change my phone password soon. Had a not so pleasant dream of a new perspective on how people get trapped in violence when the other party doesn't want to back down and the need to fight - weird dream XD. Then day went on, cssi was fun and I learned something new. Also nerded out about some cool websites. Couldnt do long yoga session today so I just did 15 mins, had to stand for like 30 mins waiting for the bus :*). Hmmm wat else. Tried to go capeless in sky and it worked for a few scenarios 😭😭😭. Uhhhhh I'm still working on finishing my anime finder app possibly by the end of the week. That's a reasonable plan tbf...alsonfinished the javascript course today but I skipped the dang 8 hour section with not really many regrets. The vue course is a lot smaller!!! :D gtg now tto

He wanted me to be his teaching assistant for one of his courses. I don't know if it was a joke but I don't care, I like that class. I also think I'm pretty good with code, for example, today we had to do some exercises in python and I did really well. I had one of those moments where I do something, and it works but I don't know how I did it or I know how I did it but I'm really impressed with myself because sometimes I get very confused.

Then uber back home and did a call with dr baani taan who's my advisor for future me hehe. The call went great. I'm gonna do the Aleks module thingy later today or probably even after this journal. Then made a pretty good lunch with what we have at home which isnt much. But then was able to go to the room to do my yoga ayyy. It was such a great practice, my jump to seated move was on pointttt. At the end of the yoga it started raining, like whatttt. Also saw a squirrel getting attacked by a bird hahahha. Now I'm here happy talking to you. Happiness is fun!!

I'm trying not to get too sad about it since it serves no purpose but my dad was super bummed. Then my mum started with her stuff and he had to call her out, and I'm pretty sure they're both angry at each other right now but peoole fight. Its especially annoying tho cause mr lanre died of hypertension as far as I know and no one wants to be stressing every day. I'm sure my parents have already gone through lots of stress in their life :(. Then there was the issue of fireworks. Before we left, there were a few that were like grenade gunshot times 2 level loud which was super scary and the place was pretty smoky. I want to live in a neighborhood where I dont have go wonder whether a loud noise was a gunshot or fireworks. Also witnessed a protest ish lol. Er did do the scavenger hunt thingy which was funnn, we won haha but had to run around the city which was super fun, even to the canada border. I emailed my advisor - Dr bani taan about when we should set up a call and errthing. Also did a 40min long yoga session today. In general the good balanced out the bad today pretty okay.

It still doesn't change things. We have been in this apartment for so long and I'm sure we have no idea when we're leaving...funn...5 people leaving in a flipping one bedroom apartment in an unsafe neighborhood...story of my life :*)...for now, I shall unwrite it one step at a time

    Entry: Okay so sky just had an update and I can get new emotes!!!! CRAB WALK HERE I COME!. For the program, I'm feeling....conflicted. I feel like we did quite a bit of advanced stuff and I was able to keep track but I think it was apparent to me at least that they know a lot of stuff about this compared to me, when it comes to math at least. It kinda freaked me out and made me afraid to answer questions, which I shouldn't be, even though I'm wrong 99 percent of the time. I also haven't really connected with anyone which is super fun. I don't even still know most of their names XD. The dude has the girl, the other dude has the other dude and other dude with other dude. And then there's me......I dont wanna think too much about it, I have nothing against any of them, like at all. Either I have to put myself out there and start conversations which is absolutely good and outside my comfort zone, or i stay In a shell ish. Instead of complaining, I'll try to start conversations with a few of them and see where that takes me. Met a super cool professor tho XD. Also I'm realizing my far sight vision is absolutely HORRRRRRIIIIBBBLLLE and I need glasses but I'm not saying anything because my mum would just be like - it's the blue light glasses you bought - and I really really do not want to deal with any of her stuff. Especially not right now. I also arrived late to class, fun. To be honest, this has not really being a fun experience. I'm only two days in but overall coming to class and getting taught was intimidating but I'm learning new things kinda which is cool. Then with the people, I have nothing against them and it might just be me putting a wall around myself to avoid getting hurt but I dont see myself spending time around any of them. It's a bummer I cant have  the people I have online in the real world :*) they also now know my age so I should be able to get away with getting some answers wrong at least loll. It rained quite a lot. Tomorrows wednesday and another day there, hopefully things get better and I connect with one of them. I was gonna say in the grand scheme of things they're gonna be insignificant in my life then I remembered I'd have classes with some of them loll. I'm not going to be social if I dont want to. I'll try, but I'll listen to my body

    Entry: These past few days have been so weird. Especially at night. I've been getting a really down heavy feeling when I'm around my mum, which can stem from a lotttaa stuff. I also feel like i want to be a lot more secluded and not share as much. I've also been feeling sad ish, the university thing gets me down quite a bit. Also the apartment which is now getting me down, it's really not a good place. I've been very ungrateful for what I have lately in short form. I did have a pretty long convo with raine today which was good and it rained all day. I also did quite well when it comes to coding but I still cant shake off the feeling. The time I got reincarnated as a slime is a joy as usual. Especially geld and goblin girl :*) I'd love to live in a place like that

And then they sent an email with room and board included and only 16k in scholarship. Which was no no. Amador cleared it up. But my parent. Mostly dad is worried about it. I however, am big time worried about the rose parks scholarship. I'm not like 100 percent sure of everything and I'm hoping that on july, I'll have my bearings and send them the document they need.  One thing that waved over me, a feeling I don't like. It's not as "ugly" as the feeling when i had to take the SAT but it's on a lower level. Is the fact that I'll have moments of worrying a lot. In the future especially and I would not be able to escape it. I really dont wanna br feeling worried all the time >-<. I'm also gonna get compensated for the interview upper week, ayyyy. I might have to get a uber tho because the interview is downtown for two days. I also have graduation rehearsal tomorrow and I need to print my speech!!!!! Hmmmm, so right now. Focusing on one thing at a time. OH gosh I should start focusing on only one thing at a time.   I'm focusing on the graduation rehearsal and the cookout!!!! Now I'm excited about the rehearsal cause I know its gonna turn out fine, a huge sense of relief just washed over me dang, this is really helpful. I'm going to start doing my best to focus on just one thing at a time, which makes everything as a whole feel A LOT less overbearing or stressful. One thing at a time, one thing at a time. One thing at a time. Focus on one thing at a time. Right now I'm focusing on the graduation rehearsal. You know what I'm gonna make a list of the things I've learned   Ooh also update, I'm still reading dragonsblood and it's getting intense, aLso have another spanish book I'm getting into :D. My anime site is going GREATTTTT, it's working awesomely and I'm giving myself the chance to not do the JS course if I don't want to as long as I'm working on it but really I have a lotta free time so I work on it either ways. I'm also planning on launching it :P which hopefully would become a popular site

Its super fun. I designed and finished the ui today cause I'm a boss XD. I feel like I could easily finish it tomorrow. Well not easily lol. But I'll use it to search for animes and I also plan on adding new features!! Its gonna be a cool side project. Github is a bitch and it's really annoying, mostly cause i dont know how to use it lol. I spend a big chunk of the day coding cause no school honeyyyy. Imma read my grad speech to ms tillman tomorrow. Hmmm what else, I need to slow down for that XD. Ughhh Daniel's house was so good lolll. I'm gonna add my anime project and manifest+ to my portfolio once I'm "done" with both of them.

I played with Britt and a new friend and it was so awesome, we went to valley oob!!! And chatted for quite a long time. Also I did a rainbow and then three people - one leading - came up to me and signaled for me to follow them. Then I did with britt and they pointed at the rainbow and it brightened my day up so much!!!!!!! We have a personal project for the internship which ends next week. This is the last week of school and I have no idea how I feel about that. Future me is going to be very relieved lol. I'm gonna hop into 7th hour calls tho, just to talk to ms Johnson. My knee hurt for my leg workoit again, however I did a hiit workout in replacement and after a while in the workoit - played while doing skribbl in class XD - it stopped hurting which was kinda surprising but I'll have to switch to less impactful exercises. Today was a devour day- that's what I'm calling things lol - where I jjey feel like my body **consumes** everything that goes in it immediately. We are on out way to pick up our mum and I have a new ritual of reading dragonsblood while in the car and I'm really enjoying it. I'm on book 3 too!! Oh I forgot to say the robin gave birth XD, or well it has bebes now. I need to get some pictures soon. Also senior cookout is soon. This was quite a long checkin, byee

Doing the pushups. My elbows ached and my knees ached during pistol squats so its smartest for me to step back and do yoga for the rest of the week.

And I still havent dealt with my face chubiness. I did have a sick chest pump from a jaxblade workout vid thooooo XD.i led a moth into the secret place at hidden forest. Dammit I shouldve taken a picture:*(. Hmmm oh I found myself worrying a lot about the stress of the future and time for my pep talk. You shouldn't worry about the future. You're just taking away the joy of the present and you'll never get that back. I sound so smart lol but its true, I was worrying that I wont be able to handle the stress of software dev so I'd need to ask daniel for help for the freaking thing I'm stuck on. A PROPOSITO, daniel signed up for my webinar OMGGGG I have to crush it at that webinar. Also I dont think I mentioned this here but I may get a 26k scholarship. God give me the opportunity to get this scholarship. I havent dont an in depth journaling like this in a while and I've missed it. Yesterdays yoga session was actually really cool and I saw that throughout this and maybe next month. My brother is going to be at school in person Mondays and wednesdays which is perfect for my working out. Ms johnson also came to pick up the stuff for the food ddrive and we had a whole long combo about feminism and climate change XD. I'm off to read more tho. Goodnight. This writing made me feel good. Despite not being on discord a lot, I feel like I'm more in touch with myself. So no worrying about the future okay?

    Entry: I actually feel pretty rad today. Started on my eating plan with max of 600 calories for each meal. Make LENTIL BURRRRRITOOOSS that tasted super great, had nice sleep. Did a hiit workout instead of yoga and felt pretty good actually. Ingrid keeps messaging me about the hustle pro series eeeeeh.  Oh and I still havent responded today Detroit promise but I'm not gonna let that ish ruin my day. I've basically given up on them and the scholarships sadly. I started designing a bird application that looks pretty cool so far. I have the award show with ms Fisher tomorrow and since ms Johnson isnt in class. I should be able to workoit. Oh and I got some chicken and I'll try to cook it eeeee:D. So tomorrow would be - Class - Award - Workout - Hustle pro - Chill. :D hopefully tomorrow turns out great

Slime is also AWESOME like battle scenes rile me up so freaking much. What else I met a friend in sky that was super fun to talk to!! ALSO I DEPLOYED MY WEBSITE WITH GITHUB PAGES and yayyyy I'm super happy that it worked. I dont have a custom domain but that's the last of my worries rn. I also sent the video to ms Johnson. I really dont like the voice over or the quality of the videos but theres not really anything we can do unless I screen record which isnt a bad idea. I'll have to tell her that tomorrow. Ate a buncha protein and actually did pretty good calories wise. Or I think so. I dont know I want to start a lean bulk and then cut or just try to maintain since its summer. That's a choice I'd have to make. Soapy basically abandoned the server but I dont really care about that now. It's time to revive it again. I think I feel more energized and RAD!!

    Entry: Ewek I domt feel like writing but I will. I made pancakes today by trading my pizza for banana XD. I had to not eat for a while just not to overeat but I ended up just calorie wise. Coding club today was okay but we encountered a hurdle. Then i finished the student council vid and shared it with ms Johnson. Did a bit of relaxing and reading. Today was pretty chill. Joy emailed and said she wants to set up a call next week for my parents. Nslt call is in exactly a week. I've been feeling pretty good with my body face wise. So I'm not holding any fat or showing any increase in fat in my face, but I feel like some days I lose muscle definition and other days, I look really *robust* which sounds weird lol. I keep having expectations for the cssi program and I dont wanna have any expectations ugh. I was supposed to receive an email but didnt get it, which is strange but I'll wait to see what they say. Anyways I'm still loving sky and want to save enough hearts to buy a cool Cape. I need to find ways to trade in my candle for hearts tho. Ugh I wanna skip brushing my teeth today XD but I cant do that

I worked out while my parents got vaccinated, didnt get best sleep but went through a great day. Then I got a form from u of d and then things went downhill. I'm just pretty 80 percent sure I wont be able to get a good scholarship and go there but I'll just have to make with community college them :*). Its not bad. Bjt I was kinda expecting something different. Sadly that's not the case. Anyways I'm done with re zero, watching telenovela now and watching mi telenovelaaaaaa. Ugh today was almost perfect. almost.

    Entry: I'm actually feeling good now. Its pretty surprising. We had the poetry prose with dr Yolanda and it was actually pretty eye opening. I also made a speech and SURPRISED MYSELF. Like I couldnt remember what I said afterwards. Something like, showing your vulnerability is what makes you a real man, and no one would really get to know you if you always have a shield around your emotions. It was fire lolllll. Also I was watching this vid on justin baldoni house and its soooooooo goalssssssss. Like a combo of his and the magicians house are my pure goals. I'd love to be able to make enough money to build a house like that and live comfortably. BUT we all know them hurdles that we have to pass through so no expectations...like...at all hehe XD. Just going to keep taking things one step at a time, and I'll find my way

    Entry: Okay so I was at an arcade today and showed daniel my portfolio!!! He said he really liked it and gave some tips. I'm not doing any coding for the rest of the weekend to set some boundaries for myself and so that I dont get burnt out. I had that feeling again at the arcade where after I've  been at a place for too long, I begin to feel heavy or like I wanna leave. I ate and it went away XD. I did overeat today :(. Feeling gordito lol. I did get messages that I had grown :D, so that's good XD. Senior photos is on monday, I dont know if I should go on a mini restriction so that I dont have a buncha face fat for the photos. This is why I dont wanna have senior photos ugh. I might also need to cut my hair, yay. Okay let's walk through my day since I have time. Woke up and had a relatively great sleep, and then I hopped into continuing tweaking my personal site. Then made mashed potatoes, we went to the arcade, I had some plain nuggets. Came back and read a bit. Watched telenovela till now. It's getting gooood. Also I went into a bit of a research phase about Arlington and best cities in us to live. One of those days. I really did overeat dinner ;(. Dammit, that's what I get lol. Anywaysss goodnifhr

HAPPY EARTH DAYYY. Today I was so busy but the highlight was going to school and taking pics of central with ms Johnson. I also took chai tea lol. The school now actually feels and looks pretty good. I also met up with some new mentors and I feel like I'm gonna match with one - Kevin pretty well. Hes a front end dev. I'm almost off to bed but even though today was super busy and my workout wasn't the best but my eating was also not the best. I like it overall. I think I managed to stay in a relative deficit even thought I've been feeling a bit relatively chubby for the past few days and I tended to ear more than 3 meals. I'm gonna absolutely destroy myself for tomorrow's workout. I need to redeem myself!!!!!

    Entry: Okay so a part of my life is going well, another not so much. I feel myself slipping fitness wise. I've gotten stronger on the archer pushups but I feel like my diet has been lacking severely. I still maintain a great physique but now that my abs are withering away as a result of being on my deficit, I knoww that It.was going to reach this point but I still want to be able to control myself. I've decided on not having bagels but popcorn instead. One bag is like 240 calories and its wayyyy bigger and more filling than a bagel so I'm going to start eating that. Protein based I've been doing REALLY good this past week so yay me, really yay me. Im making more lentils tomorrow and gonna do my leg workout. I cant wait. Apart from that fitness is going pretty good, I need to keep the momentum for working out going. What's next for my website, things are going awesome. I used the intersection observer and it works like a charm :D and it's not that hard to figure out anymore. I know the documentation will be there if I ever need it tho.Talking about brant again sorry but his drawings are awesome, websites may not be his strong suit tho. However it's not meant to be but no more talking about him. I'm sti finetuning my sleep and speaking of that u need to sleep now. Today was a pretty good day

    Entry: Just feeling meh in general cause I'm visualizing all the hurdles I have to cross to be where I want to be il. :cringeface:. Tryig to think of a positive spin on this. Let's recount my story. Okay so me, born in nigeria a third world country. Not the best life, but it was fun, full of memories at least lol. Then moved to america, now with a whole new set of good experiences with a bit of challenges. I love that I'm here every day, but today just focusing on the challenges. College and career choice, actually just college. I'm focusing way too much on scholarships and not being a full on citizen. I still have a lit of good things. I'm getting cs experience. Specifically js. Even though I have a long way to go. IM WAYYY CLOSER THAN WHEN I FIRST STARTED!!! LIKE I was still learn about functions and didnt even know what doc.getelbyid was. Now I'm learning more complex topics. Still developing step by step. I just feel like I'm jealous of brant. Just jealous of the difference in our starting points. With him being born in a well to do place with a lotta opportunities at least. I know his life isnt perfect by any shot, but I still cant help but think of the things he has that I dont. Anywaysss i have a lot of things to be grateful for, like light 24/7. Or like the experience I've gotten. With like Kapor and eddy and gale and Shay and daniel and Richard. I've met so many people and I'm still meeting people so theres really nothing focusing on someone else's life would do than make me feel less happy about mine.speaking of Kapor, we have a call tomorrrowww. It would be pretty cool to catch up!

Pero esa no es la razón por que siento mal, es que, creo que he estado deslizando en mi nutrición. Pues, yo sé que he, I'm just gonna type in English, I know that I've had an overall better relationship with savoring food and experimenting but i feel like I lose control and overdo it :(. Now that I'm coming off the deficit, I immediately feel like I'm gonna start gaining fat and I'm gonna be obsessing over whether my abs show or not and I dont want that, no lo quiero. Ugh. Another thing is that I feel like some days I look great Nd other days, I look not the best. I know that in the end my physique is still pretty good but I feel like I've not being as proud of my physique as I should be, and I havent been proud in a long time. Idk if it's because I feel like I'm not making any muscle gains or I fluctuate way too easily. Cause now I've been working out for almost two years, crazy XD, and I have no intentions of stopping. Workingojt out is basically mandatory to me now, I havent skipped a workout in so long, I used this week to experiment and I think it went well. I should compare my old progress pics to my new ones., gtg tho. Goodnight

And I know that I understand it a lot more than before, but I still think it's a little fuzzy in my head. And I need to check what I'm writing because, well, you know the reason. Anyway, I think I'm going to sleep. Good night.

    Entry: OKAY, today LARGA Dia. The wifi wasn't working all morning when I had the robotics presentation. LUCKILY I got one bar of wifi XD, and I used that throughout the presentation. Also answered questions relatively well. Feel a bit proud of myself. Offside, TEN EPISODES LEFT OF BETTY EN NY, I'm so. Sad :(. Thisnis such a great show. Okay continuing, the girl texted me or better yet, called me. And I looked her up and she has an history of running away from home. Eeeeek, I really really dont want to get involved with her right now, like at all. Then I went for the journo call. I need to turn in this document stuff. And now for the reason I'm men, side note daniel gave me headphones. But I'm restructuring my goals. I feel like the cut is over now. It was good while it lasted, like I know I lose weight. Not a ton of weight, but I lost enough. Now I feel like I'm slipping and I need to set more goals ( I felt like quitting the fitness server, cause I'm tired of giving people advice but the advice also works for me as it's like a "thing" of mine that I listen to my own advice, but now I wan4 to try to maintain my weight and get off this cut. First I'm moving towards my tdee, which is around 2300 to 2500 cals. So I'm going to be eating at around 2100 to 2200 calories. This time instead of overestimating, I need to find a way to properly measure things. So starting today, new goal I'm gonna increase my calories slowly till I reach 2100 to 2200 calories. Then workout wise. I'm hella sore from the chest workout that I did. Like super super sore. Not sure if I'm gonna be sore from this leg workout tho. I'm thinking of ditching yoga and replacing it with cardio. Whaddaya think. Idk if I'm still getting the benefits of yoga for only 30 minutes a week. It feels like a waste of time and I may have to get out of yoga for a while. I'm gonna do the cardio session tomorrow and let you know the results. I've already set my calories to 1900 and damn I just wish that savvy was still in the group :(. I still miss him

What I'm going to do over spring break to cherish it   For the first thing, I need to find a way to maintain my weight. I'm still going to be tracking but I need to be way more precise ;(. I also need to keep working out, hmm, eat better foods too. Just need to keep being creative. What's next for the spring break. I'm thinking of daily walks? Alternative productivity days. I'm not really sure, feeling a bit bummed

Was still a bit bummed that I couldnt get a great picture :(. Spent the whole say watching Betty en ny. That show is so gooood hahahahah, telenovelas ftw. I'm a bit concerned about my eating tho. I feel more inclined to eat no no stuff, those fudge cookies do a number on me XD. I dont know if I should be productive during the spring break or not. Better yet actually, I can be both, Monday would be productive. Tursfay notx and so on. That should work. Also hoping to test different workout methods but still sticking to the upper lower split. I was really thinking about ending my cut this week but now I'm not sure because I feel like I undid a buncha progress eek. I am still practicing my Spanish AND DID I SAY I REACHED A ONE YEAR STREAK WOOO WOOP. Hmm que mas, have Lluvia ahora y lo amo muchísimo, necesito descansar pero todavía quiero relajarme antes de dormir. También a veces creo mi mis habilidades de español han crecido pero otras veces, siento como nunca voy a aprender a formar oraciones largas. Es un rollercoaster. Ahora estoy en el baño pero quiero mirar unos vídeos en YouTube, entonces hasta luego. También antes de voy. Sentí que tenía mucho suerte, porque siempre hay electricidad, y estoy en usa, es como. He olvidado mi vida en Nigeria pero no. Esta vida es muy diferente, pero en un buena manera. Creo que voy a traducir este después jaja no sé cuantos errores he cometido. Es un buen cosa mirar las telenovelas, creo que yo sé el telenovela que voy a mirar después de betty en ny pero no sé.  También quiero alguien con quien puedo practicar mi español y practicar. Ahora me voy, adios

Less than 500 cals per meal or just skip a meal. Need to push my body

Same thing happened with semilogo at the debate, you almost ripped your paper because he did so freaking good, I dont like that feeling, so I'm going to need to confront it headfirst, it's the same feeling about the SAT, I really really dont like the feeling. Need to find a way do deal with it, but first gonna accept it and see where it's coming from. And that's not because I just dont like the feeling itself, but I don't want to feel that way against someone I really like. On a positive side, I went to the ally call and learned a bit about ai, also asked a question, yay. Worked on the PowerPoint for robotics and I actually really like it, not done yet tho

Why not push myself to the max and not waste my time amirught. I also realized the difference between being full, like actually full because of a good meal, or being full as in being full cause of trash, the trash feels lower in my belly while the good feels like it's all around, its weird I know XD. Anyways I FINALLY LOGGED INTO THE U OF M CANVAS AND IF I HAVE THE MERIT SCHOLARSHIP, I WOULD BE SO FREAKING HAPPPPPPYYYYYU REEEEEEEEEEEEE. I TEXTED SOMEONE CALLED NICHOLAS AND HE HELPED ME, ugh God bless nicholas. Beef left the server again, she has been really annoying me, well, just the scenario cause shes always leaving and focusing on the past, not the future which irks me. Giles brought a research about mask increasing covid risk and I think I debunked it pretty good, readings studies is fun! For the project, I'm feeling a bit down :( I'm trying to implement a new feature for deleting but idk how to do it. I think I have an idea. If I have the data locally and only update it to the server when I click a button, I can create an array and spread the values in that, and then push those values. But I should also be able to extract the username for the specific values but I doubt it, *sadnsss*. Anyrays it's late and I need to brush, byee

    Entry: Okay starting with the good news, I received my pay for the KSLTTTT, the last payment. Bad news, I feel super malllll. And very very very very very very stressed like in dizzying myself in stress and I have a plan but in just worrying without reason. Basicammy an update, miesha wants me to fill out the FAFSA, however we have already established that my parents dont want me to fill out the FAFSA. One thing, so now I have to tell her that my parents dont want me to fill out the FAFSA. SECOND, is taking the sat ughhh, I still need to hop on a call to get mr Alexander to help me sign the document thingy and then get a calculator and then tell my parents UGHHHHHHHHHH. My head is spinnnunnggg, j tried to just leave things be and let( another issue, I keep saying ley the universe take care of things, I dont know why but I feel super guilty whenever I say let God take care of things because it feels like I'm only coming to him for help and then ignoring other times which makes me feel super mal. Ughh creating a plan didnt work as I continued to worry about it, and ignoring the plan also didnt work. Heart racing ughhhhhhh. Que boy a hacer. WHY DONT I SHUT IT ALLLLL DOWNNN TO THE GROUNDDD. Okay sooo so so so so soooo, hmmm, wHt I'm thinking. Is to tell miesha that my parents feelclike filling out the fafsa is unnecessary and will only be a waste of time cuz my dad wants me to go to the community college that hes going through as he knows someone who can help us with the immigration and schooling stuff. Also tell her that I really dont feel like retaking the SAT WHICH I know will be a big slap on her face. But the counselor said that if I look hard, I should be able to find some good scholarships with my score and GPA. So since I'm not going to apply f.......okay fuck.this.shittttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.....this feels like it's not gonna help me and I'm just trying to rationalize, reee. But, but imma practice, "my dad said that he has already set things up so that I'm also going to go to the community college thag hes going to, because he knows someone there who can help with immigration and other college stuff, it's also the cc that my brother is going go. So there wouldnt be any point in applying for the FAFSA cuz I wont need it for the community college. Whadays think. Then her response. Then I also feel like now. Taking the sat seems pointless as I'm not going to be applying to any other schools. Okay okay I'm done, that's going to be the plan. Gonna take a breather

It's not foolproof and i have to stay dynamic for anything that follows. then i got NITROOOOOOOOOO SHSJEBEIBEIE happy mousse sand nitro dances.soo happy rreeeeeeee. Okay so an then I had a great convo with x about dooode stuff, hush, you dont need to know XD. Today was full of ups and down. Mostly ups. Made a BOMB tuna sandwich. I absolutely hate the feeling of overhelmdness, it like takes over and paralyzes my internals. Well not everything lasts forever thankfully. And luckilllllllyyyyyyyy,completely forgot what I was going to say it's late and I flee. Goodnight

    Entry: Today was...good. felt super motivated almost all day with working out, great chest workout by the way. And with work and everything m, didnt have tutoring today. However I'm going to come clean, I keep panicking everytime I think of taking the sat. I'm going to first ask niesha if I'm taking the SAT for scholarships or to apply to college. Based on her answer, Imma tell her that the counselor said that I already have a high GPA and sat score to get scholarships. I wonder what her response would be. Also missed a call from Richard, but I feel like listening to some sad songs lol. Hmmm I feel conflicted, sad that I didnt go to the call Richard sent but I was in coding club. And hm kinda bummed that he spent all that money on me. I dont even think I want to take the sat anymore . I can tell him that but then all the sat prep would be to waste. Lesson of today, speak your mind. Dont make him pay a grand to give you sat prep if you dont want it. Speak your mind dude. So its planned, I'll ask miesha about why I'm taking the sat prep and tell her what mr Alexander said, if I end up having to take the sat, I'll take it. It wont kill me but I need to have my Id and calculator ready. I'd ask mr Alexander to help me for the Id and say that I want to try to get a better math score. And then I can buy the calculator to use for the sat.

Ooh ooh i think my cut is starting out well, going in a caloric deficit but i feel like I'm underestimating my calories. I did manage to resist temptation to eat something, it kinda worries me how when I felt hungry, I immediately stood up to estbread, if I didnt realize that I'm in a midst of a cut. I might've eaten it. Anyways I changed my phone language to spanish haha. Ooh ooh and I DONT HAVE BIOLOGY CLASS ANYMORE.

Learned about the glossy ibis and started working on some mini github projects that deal with javascript and scss as a way of learning them combined. For scss we have to use the --watch scss file css fileoutput in order to start, and then we can use functions and nestings, all that jazz. Also learned about css combinations, div > p meaning every p child of d, div ~ p as every sibling of div, and div + p as immediate siblings. I gave a quick thought about moving to silicon valley but I decided that I'm not going to think about it and let the universe ( God ) take me anywhere. Also was looking into developer jobs to kinda see what the market was like and joshua flukes video have been getting to me, all I can think of is the horrorrrs of getting a corporate job, will have to do more research about it tho. Dang I wasnt expecting to write a whole paragraph this night. Also yoga was bomb as hexkk!!!! It was a super nice flow, perfect timing and exercise and errthing. I also almost started a bulk today but realized that it wasnt worth it. If I'm going to bulk, I should at least have weight. My blue light glasses were supposed to come today but the freaking door couldn't be accessed. Feels bad. Anyways that's basically all for today. Gnightt

People were waiting at the road before my school and webb, so I split myself to try to stop cars coming so we passed. I then entered school, real school, I'm just realizing how much I missed it, and saw a bunch of people. David wasn't talking to me tho and I felt sad, also class was different. Cooler lol.

BUT it's about to spill out sometime soon, I feel like javascript is going to be so hard for me to learn and I wouldnt be able to do it fast. Gosh I feel like I already know how to comfort myself but my brain doesn't want to stop feeling overwhelmed. I've learned so much this week and things have been going great!!! I'm not going to stop feeling upbeat about that, tomorrow is freaking christmas, thank God I made it through 2020. Like omg!!! I've learned a ton about the vue cli, I finally understand what emits are used for, I've like ingrained into my head the fundamentals, I'm so happy with myself. Who the fluck cares if I'm not doing enough, after I'm done with this vue course, I'm going to work on a project to start a portfolio, and once I'm done with that project, I will start the javascript tutorial. I still have freaking 7 or 6 months till graduation??!!! I can learn a lot during that time and feeling overwhelmed will not help me AT ALL. So I'm going to keep us this progress :D. I'm also not going to worry about javascript, I'll learn more about vue and become proficient, then I'll delve into javascript, if it's tough, I'll tough it out. I believe in myself

I'm actually going super great with vue and I understand more about the vue cli. App.vue is what automatically shows on the front page while we can add components to it. I'm a bit confused about the routing part now, fluck 😂😂. I know that for routing, we now use components as pages and the app.vue now shows the router-view tag with the default page being set in the main.js, where a component can be imported and set to a path of "/" but imma not confuse myself now. I know that the app.vue is the main file even with the default and components get shown there

I picked up on learning vue and now consider myself a total beginner. Taking it one step at a time

    Entry: I had one of THOSEEE night. Actually, today was a mess, so it started out badly, found out that the mousepad still wasn't working and ordered a mouse. But ms hobson canceled class and I was so happy, maintained a positive outlook on the whole mousepad thing. So continuing throughout today, ate a good breakfast and held off on the banana bread. So I did yoga and immediately after THE MOUSEPAD was working!!! It was bloody awesome haha. I'm so thankful to God, so I continued on to watch betty la fea and was able to keep up A LOT more than before, I'm proud of myself lol, but I knew and felt it, that this day was going to come. I had one of THOSE nights. Thinking of my future, so here's what happened, I realized that working in the software developing world might be the way to go. Hesr me out , I'm still going to work with animals, but,but, as a volunteer like raine. As a s.d, I will be able to go to the gym consistently, bird and maybe even travel with the money and not be limited by work. Even though there's still the nagging disadvantage of staring at a screen all day. However, since I'm starting relatively young, I know I still have a upper hand or a benefit. I'm going to be dedicated to learning about vue. This will be in the mornings before school, I'm also going to make sure to follow along on his tutorials and rewatch the ones I dont understand. I'm getting a bit excited but I know it might fade tomorrow so I'm keeping it low level and planning on reading this journal. I still have a LONG way to go, but at least I'm doing it. I also feel like I dont know what I'm doing compared to when coding club was still a thing, but I'm going to work towards it. Take it one step at a time, and you find your way

Rn, I'm actually rethinking my whole career ecology thing. I'd love to learn ecology, and not cuz of my parents, but from what I've seen, the job search is a horror which can be very very bad.

Anyways I didnt feel like going to school but I did relatively well, then I listened to roy shakked, and did a super calm yoga session. It was so great, now I'm at academic games chilling

You know how everything is, worry and you get ducked. So calmate. That's what I'm gonna be focusing on, I typically find myself in arguments in my head and getting sucked into things mentally. Things will be different now I hope, imma focus on not focusing on the.problem lol. I also "plan" or just wanna design a website for the env clubs using vue, which I could say that I'd forgotten a lot of. Vue.createapp even slipped my mind. I guess I dont have to be memorizing stuff tho but idk, I guess I'd give coding another try. Not being optimistic tho, I just wanna work on my responsiveness skills

    Entry: Today's thanksgiving day, and we had turkey, it was good. On to the bad part. I dont think I might major in ecology 😖. Okay first, my parents wouldnt support it, but I'm not doing it for them. Doing some research, ( that was probably a bad idea ),a degree in ecology might not be the best thing, the job security is iffy most times, and we all know that the salary isnt the best. And even though I can adapt my standard of living, there may be unpredictable periods like this one that I need to take into mind. HOWEVERRR, that doesnt mean I wont do what's in my power to help the environment, like I promised Gilbert, even though I might not major in ecology. I'm going to volunteer and donate. Since a job in computer science ( I have to find which part is right for me, so not just coding ) is most commonly stable, I should be able to have opportunities like travel, hiking, volunteering, and I think most importantly, donating. Even though my dreams of waking up and going to work to help the environment and the people in any way I can might be put off ( who knows, the ecology bug might sting me sometime in the future ), I would be able to help in more indirect ways, even if that means spreading info on the discord. This is not final tho. I could even volunteer at a wildlife sanctuary while doing that! Who the f knows what the future will hold

My dad still doesnt support my plan of being an ecologist soooo imma have to come up with a contingency plan, I might work on it tonight or early tomorrow, last day before break btw. For the contingency plan, if I cant major in ecology, I'll look for like an ok job in tech to sustain myself while regoing back to community college then school for ecology. I'll be roughly 20 when I graduate college so that means I'd still be relatively young. While in college for the first time, I'll try my best to get as much experience in the env field, so when I actually go to college for env, I'll have some experience. I'll save this for my plan tho

    Entry: Saw crows this morning and it's raining a bit rn.not sure what else happened today. Continued the science of happiness course. Oh and I'm looking for another digital hobby, sketchup expires tomorrow ( getting sat scores 9 days after today). Idk what else. Today was pretty boring and I just realized how I dont feel loved in this family, thanks science of happiness course lol. But really, it sounds weird and it feels okay to me but I feel out of place a lotta times in this family. My mum is the opposite and I mean opuesto if supportive so I've chosen to ignore her. For example when I'm taking pictures and shed be staring, and then shed be criticizing someone ugh. My dad is okay tbh, better than her in a lot of ways. If she reads this journal lol, it's not a lie tho, shes closed minded, arrogant, likes to feel in control, and just an overall annoying person. But then her personality shifts so much. One day shes all I mentioned and another, it's like someone drugged her lol. It's not like shes nice or anything, just that she doesnt show the annoying personalities I listed. I did a voice chat with tuna and the group and it was so fun lol. Sibling wise, I'm also different and I love that. I may be generalizing here but both are into tech and games. Not sure about mofe and dont really care. Like too be honestttttttttt, I wish ( I was going to say I wish I had better parents but no ), I wish I had parents that would support my choices and lifestyle, and do what they can to see me succeed in it. Off to bed now, guess this was more interesting than I thiught

On to why I'm feeling bad, I guess I'm realizing more that the world is an unfair place and I kinda already know that, basically I feel super jealous of Brant. Why am I jealous of someone miles away and I dont even know their life you may ask. Welll, his parents support his career choice, he lives in a super well to do neighborhood and he goes on a bunch of "adventures" like going to the zoo and taking some awesome pictures. However looking at things now, I seem shallow. Ooh jealous of someone who might seem perfect on the surface without knowing their real life. Tbh I also feel bad that I compare myself to other people to make me feel better. Thanks parents lol. I just started learning about birds and a bunch of them have been doing it for years. I also feel like I seem and I am super shallow about this. I need to learn how to be happy with myself and where I am😪

Had one of those thoughtful days where I looked st myself and tried to plan out my life again, this time, focusing more on the financial aspect of things. I'm always like *hmm. I should be learning vue so that I at least have sth to make money* and then I dont know why but learning vue fills me with so much dread, it's weird. Maybe I just made this happen myself but it's still there. I think I should learn it tho and get "excited", tbh I'm more excited about the arduino part. I showed ms Fisher and the class my pics and they liked it :))), I'm planning on going out tomorrow too, more birding hehe. Election is still happening, HOPEFULLY BIDEN WINS. have to get ms Hobson's project by MONDAY. F me.

I also did a good exercise and now I'm having like a mini brain worry. So like if my parents are just gonna choose my career path for me, then what am I going to do. But, you know what, I'm going to argue. Switching to third person. Stand your ground ara, you've heard it so many times and know that it's true, if I dont go into the field that I want to, I'm going to regret it big time, and everyone encounters a road block while trying to achieve their dreams. I've been looking for volunteer opportunities and i dont fit into a lot of the criteria. First is age which i can't change, but I've found some good physical ones. However cuz of covid, that's a no go. The one thing I'm scared of tbh is my mum and her opinionated self, like she's doing mofes  college thing, they would then want to force me to go into technology. However I still think I need to focus on "tech" but not in the way I think. Learning vue is boring to me, but learning about ecosystems isnt, random things if my parents say ecology is my hobby, I'm gonna lose it. Cuz tech is the hobby, not ecology, and as an hobby, it can pay the "bills". Ugh I might need to look for side jobs that I can do to earn cash tho.  Hmmmmmm, should I bite the dust and try to focus a little bit more on vue???, that's the million dollar question

I'm getting really turned off by learning vue eith the vue course and I dont wanna think about it. My stomachs still ful from dinner. My brother got his phone today and I started to get really nervous about my package, because my mum and her mouth, not in an offensive way but I've been finding her really intolerable lately or I'm just irritable and need to get some rest. Um what else, I learned about altricial animals that are basically useless at birth and I learned about the guacamaya bird which is the burd that was on that binder with rainbow wings, it's a parrot btw. That's basically it, I'm trying to not worry, knowing that worrying is useless and the universe would f me up if I worry. And that's basically it

I guess this is my new hobby, plus photography, I'm making my dream house but I need to plan, still learning about birds and nature in general. My spanish learning has slowed a bit tho, I did learn that If im.going to use to in aconversation, like I'm giving this to him, or I'm getting this for ella, you use le, so yo le doy a el, or yo le llego para ella. And then le in general is for people and lo is for things

I learned about the roseated spoonbill which is like this rose egret with a big spoon shape beak, and also horned screamers which have this cartilage horn and little spurs or knives at the end of their wings. Lastly, hornbills have like a big head lol. Hopefully I get good sleep today

For leadership class, I dont know if ms Johnson assigned both of them to me or sth but Bryan and nya were responding to me and even put a chat with only me and them, I think ms Johnson facilitated that lol but I still felt good. I think I'm done with daddy's essay and I had the best yoga session that I've had in months. I dont know why, it just was. I'm going to do whatever now, cya

Maybe she was trying to escape somewhere cuz she kept asking to a scissors to take the tether off. I said that I didnt have any and I wasnt lying, but she had blood and I didnt want to touch it. I had to leave her, then she entered my apartment and I just had to come across her and dodge her, oof. I wish i could help her, but i dont know her situation and i might be doing a bad thing, she really was bleeding tho but it didnt look like it mattered to her.

    Entry: Still not feeling 100 but its wayyyy better than yesterday, I just wish that my mum would stay where she works at least 4 days a week. And I'm not being like evil or anything like that, her presence is honestly HONESTLY EXHAUSTINGGGGGG, I saw that she looked up eucology instead of ecology and if that 2 minute search is what is influencing her, then she needs to chi chi chickety check herself. Lol. In case someone is reading this without my permission. F u. Ummm what else, oh I've been having conflicting thoughts about running vs jogging annddddddddd wow I just realized that I had a really big appetite after my first run, or jog. Anyways, sprinting is basically better than jogging for my goals ( muscle strength and explosive power) while jogging is basically heart health and cardiovascular things, also weight loss, WHICH ISNT BAD, Its just not my main focus but I'm still gonna do it cuz at least itll help me in the future. The muscles can flow away but at least im strengthening my heart and oooh I just realized that lol. I'm still gonna sprint but I need to be able to get back on my previous level, which was being able to jog continously without stopping, also I need to strengthen my knees lol. I have prepped and planned for tomorrow tho so that's good. Um what else, I'm pretty o, kay with my physique now. It's not like groundbreaking but its no like, wow you need to get in shape kind of deal. Now I really see the benefits of yoga when I'm stressed lol, inhale, exhaleeee. Also I'm starting a vue 3 course and honestly, honestlyyyy, I dont think coding is the right thing for me, or maybe I havent found the perfect programming language for me yet. Buttt, I dont feel excited or like wow  woah, when learning vue, it's more like, men, vue.createapp, mount(), app.component, I can use this for that, error so confusing, ugh, I used that to like practice lol but that's beside the point. I dont feel the same way when I learn about ecology or climate change or even a youtube video on those. It just feels, stressed. I am trying however to continue learning it so that while, WHILE I major in ecology, ECOLOGYYYY, I can be doing that to earn some side money. Inhale, exhaleeee. I really dont know if I brought the feeling of it on myself. I'd have to investigate myself further. Bye for now

I'm angry, mostly sad, but angry, and the tears still wanna roll out but I've dedicated my mind to it and I'm not going to give up, i could pay for college myself if i get thescholarship, so just room and board.

I learned about sino tambien after no solo and other stuff. I even just finished watching betty in NY but I still feel LETHARGIC. That's the word. Puberty, maybe, I feel like I could go to sleep now.

The reason I watched all those is that TODAY WAS BLOODY DRY, it was so boring like nothing to do.

Okay my spanish, I've been taking a break for a while and that's not necessarily a bad thing, ish, I learned somethings today and I know that I have a long way to go but I know I have to take it one step at a time, conjugations still get me a little confused and the order of words so those are my main gripes, anyways my mum bought two basil plant thingys and I'm gonna try taking care of them, no one even cared to water them :*(. What else, I've been watching a lot of YouTube  oh and school starts on Tuesday...fun, no one was at the virtual orientation which was just shmur but whatever, richard collected his laptop and stuff, I'm still learning or a better word, understanding vue 3 and that's probably all I have...bye

THE WILDLIFE BUDDIES WERE BORN, tuna, Gilbert and I think lina I'm not sure, came together and made it possible and now, we're on a track to create a youtube group and maybe even voice call tomorrow and I maybe be super nervous lol. Today I didnt want to eat meat at all but my mum was staring at me which made me feel weird and eat it, but I'm not mad at myself. Also I'm finally nailing down conjugations...hoy era muy estupendo

    Entry: Today was a meditation day but I felt like I should've worked out because I dont feel really good about my body AND I KNOW ITS ALL TEMPORARY, but sometimes it gets to me, I should stop focusing on the bad, I still need to get my eating at night in check. Tomorrow I'm going to do a normal workout even though its Saturday and...yeah, that's basically it

    Entry: Well I'll be damned, today was soooooo. Uhm, first, my day started out TERRRRRIIIBBBLLLYY, I woke up late and the call had already started, I also had a dream of being back in a repo to my farm, then I saw the garden spider and walked back into a whole bunch of webs, like all the spider pics that showed up on google into my face as I fell and I woke up immediately, fell back asleep, hence waking up late, had to rush and make green tea to get the caffeine in me, I sound so dumb lol, then I joined the call and had to catch up on my day, uncle Ben came to take mofe to collect food rudely and the day continued, during the call, I realized that my watch battery had died, f me, I had to get extra batteries and do it super carefully, and guess what THE SOUND OF MY WATCH WORKS NOW, which I'm super happy about but have to learn how to take adv of it. I'm finished with learning the imperfect tense and on toconditional, but I decided to go for future tense which is kind of easy but I still feel meh about it, I talked with kristina and chatted with giraffe, I gave into the tempt at 9pm, kind of not a smart idea. Um, that's basically it, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm a 4, cuz of my relationship with spanish tenses and all around today, I did a yoga practice but I feel like it was too small, like 11 mins, I also didn't eat dinner because first, its okra and not really any benefits, so tomorrow, I thought that I was gonna be feisty and eat a lot of apple pie until I realized that my mum doesn't make the apple pie till tomorrow, fml, you know what, I'm a 3.5 now. Just me myself and omg I was also super irritable yesterday and kind of today  I miss the magician's 😂😭

    Entry: It has been long since I've done a deep dive into my behavior. Okay, for my relationships, sibling wise, I think it's generally good except for my older brother who's a pain. But what makes him a pain, I'd say not minding his own business, acting like because he's older, he's better and some ridiculous thing he says. First, not minding his business, I think this is the foundation, and the main reason why I dont respond when he talks, come to think of it, we didn't even talk in Arepo, oh wow, that's actually true, it's like we're two different people and I've learnt to distance myself from toxic people who'll only make me angry, like him. Then acting like he's better, this is also another part, one time that he fell the rack thing and I asked him to pick it up, he said that he wasn't going to do it because I said he should, i think those are signs of insecurity tbh, like a sign that he wants to be in control, this is probably a terrible analysis but its like he doesn't want someone to correct him or make him feel like the smaller person. Away from.him, for.my.physical health, I'm pretty dang happy with where I am, I still have to.deal.with overeating when it gets dark or eating wayy to much before bed.so that's what I'm gonna be working on. Tomorrow, I think.im.gonna be long fasting with a yoga session instead of normal workout, who knows, I could probably do the Wednesday workout. Anyways time. To go I REALLY NEED TO CHAT WITH GIRAFFE, like dang

I'm also really really Really happy with my physique and I'm focusing on maintaining, its not too small and not too big, workout 3 times a week with two days of yoga is like the PERFECT schedule for me, I was about to start getting worried about how I'd look in the future but I centered myself and focused on the present. Also I'm fasting, from 7 yesterday to 4 today and I haven't eaten yet, maybe I'll go till 4:30, again I'm super happy with my physique like ultra level happy

Ummmm, yeah, IM PLAYING BACKPACKING ROBLOX WITH TUNA FROM DISCORD, the game is the best ever and makes me so calm, if camping or hiking is like this irl, I wanna do it every day, bye for now, also learning imperfect and preterite spanish and I keep confusing the two but I know I'm going to fully master it if I take it one step at a time, and that means completely mastering the preterite before going on to the imperfect, even though it is easy, like Eddie says, better to be slow and understand sth than rush and know little about it

    Entry: Today was good, did breathe work for yoga, internship was good and received screen protector, but mrs Yates texted me about the spanish AP things and my brain has just been drifting on it ever since. I'm going to have to learn how to write better spanish and speak better. However she's gonna help me once class starts, she says shes gonna have focused lessons and she wants to see my weaknesses, I'm sure they are accents and conjugations, also piecing words together also leaves me confused. I feel like I might not be good enough and let her down, or that I'm going to fail the AP test and I don't know that much. This might be overreacting but that's how I feel which i know i shouldn't be thinking like that and staying positive. So I'm going to do it like she said, start one step at a time, I dont start lifting weights from 315lbs, that just leads to injury, I start small and work up, giving me better gains, same with this, I dont just jump into it thinking i can write a full essay or sth like that, I'll start small, build my way to the top while not overwhelming myself, write a little spanish everyday. That's my plan

I did a little coding and learnt about clip paths ( that can be put on images to select what part to show ), ummmm, didn't do much else, came up with an awesome idea for a book that I should probably get started but I wasn't motivated a lot today and luckily mofe went with daddy today to work :).

Tomorrow is going to be a very very busy day as we are leaving at 5 in the morning which is crazeeeee, but, BUT I'm gonna survive like I did last time, I'm not going to day, and it's going to be just another day

    Entry: Today was the definition of a rollercoaster, first I woke up with NO motivation to workout, like not at all, then I decided to fast, and did till after 4, period, today was Alaas birthday :) and the class was good, then I mustered up all my motivation from every inch of my body which was hard, to work out and it was a good tough hit, so after I planned to chill with netflix to realize that I was signed out and couldn't watch my gran hotel, making me super sad and not knowing how to progress on my spanish.  Anyways I ate a little rice and was hungry at first but it all dissipated away, hours later, I ate two bananas and night food, then this night I was having one of them thinking nights about my future and Gilbert really grounded me down and made me realize to stick in the present and face my failures heads on. Also sighdonia also gave me some tips to network with people. Now I'm looking up colleges that I have a chance to go to and the majors they offer, wcccd doesn't flipping offer ecology but it does offer science and that's what I want to go into. And rn I'm picturing my parents saying something to unmotivate me and probably make me go to a different path but I know that I have friends like Gilbert and a promise to make the world a better place by being a wildlife biologist. And I dont intend on breaking that promise. I'm going to use my networking skills to climb to Jane Goodall level but, but I'm not gonna get my hopes up and I'm gonna focus on the PRESENT, cuz that's what I'm in now and worrying is POINTLess :)...goodnight

I didn't resist :( and fasted for about 18 hours or more with a good workout in, I'm feeling proud of myself lol, however for the rest of the day, I was pretty sedentary as there was nothing else I could do that was active or non that I've come up with yet, I want to be able to ride a bike outside so bad...however, that's wishful thinking for now, peace

I feel really bad eating the ponmo and imagining how they had to tear the skin of the cow and I'm eating it rn, I can taste it in my mouth and it isn't a good taste, I know this is a setback but I'm coming back strong.i also learnt that pescatarians can choose to eat egg and cheese so that's what I'm thinking of as I think they are nutritious, the only thing I'll be staying away from is meat pork and beef, I haven't even eaten my remaining meatpie as it's filled with beef.bye for now

    Entry: My mum just has a way of making someone strongly dislike her, this morning she was talking about, not even talking, shouting blabbingly about my hygiene not knowing the full story and was like ..why don't you out deodorant, so naturally, I say nothing cuz there's no point in telling her anything and even though that might sound extreme, she never wants to listen to what someone else has to say and only wants to hear herself talk and someone support her. Like the good old saying, people don't want to hear your opinions , they only want to hear their opinion coming out of your mouth, anyways then I wanted to answer, and before I say 5 words, she's already shouting again and my dad was like let him talk, so now I just shut down angrily and just said nothing because if she's not gonna listen to Me, then I'm not gonna listen to what she has to shout. Then my dad came and talked about it and I understood a little which is why I put rollon today, if not, I wouldn't have put it. Anywaysssss, coming to today, you know how I wanna cut back on meat, welllllll she forced me to take meat and I chose liver cus it'll offer me more benefits and I just despise the fact that she thinks that everything I do is because I read it online and its super annoying but that's their life and whoever is hacking my phone and reading this can enjoy the drama which is my life. I did yoga today too and this week was really good,.during the call, two people said I did a good job explaining and I think they were lying and someone might have made them say it even though it sounds absurd cuz they didn't say it to anyone else and Alaa Is the best, literally and I hope to work with her sometime in the future, and omg the mez released a video and akin rang his bell and it brought back so much memories for me 😭😭😂😂😫, omg I miss robotics . The remainder of this week is going to be me chilling, I rewatched what the health and disagree with a lot of the stuff concerning health but I understand for the environment, only if my mum could step out of her ignorance bubble and listen for a change. My dad might be more receptive as he actually listens instead of just shouting and expecting the words to mean anything which is just counterproductive and sad as that just shows how insecure the person is about it. Anyways is my parents read this, that's their problem and they should probably start doing their own research about stuff and not just taking it from a random Facebook video of a man shouting...yeah....I'm using that against them, toodles

    Entry: Wellll, I had the call for work today and it was okay, eating wasn't super healthy nor was it super unhealthy, I worked out in the morning while everyone was asleep and felt good, then I started to feel unheard or seeking attention in the discord which is really toxic but I focused myself and managed to snap myself out of it. RN I'm thinking about becoming vegetarian/,vegan. Why you may ask, well Luther e gave me some great tips on how to become vegan AND even though I might not get all my nutrients, I'll have to do my research, if I can't go fully vegan, I'll at least cut back my consumption on meat. Then again my dad works in a slaughter house, like what the fuk. Anyways, I've just been watching some Vue 3 videos not for learning,just to see what it's all about .. and I think that's it for today...ciao

    Entry: Ugh I feel into the Vue trap of wanting to over think Vue but right now, I'm pushing it all down, my brain wants me to spill it all which is really messing my mood but I'm not going to think of that. I know I don't necessarily HAVE to do Vue stuff but it pays a lot for beginners and I'm going to use the money to maybe buy a land or house before I become a Wildlife biologist, ugh I hate feeling like this. I spilt all my dreams to the people on the discord and it felt good, I felt myself salivating 😂😂. I'm not sure I have anything else to talk about 😅, I wanted to take the cocoa after fasting but NOOOOoooO there's no milk, like wow. It was raining thunderstorm style and the roof had a mental breakdown lol, got my post work shut off, I still wanna do good for the internship to impress Richard but I'm pretty sure he's already impressed, I have an idea about having a resume section for the students if they have time so there's that. I'm going to text him now on slack about it...and ughh blech, Vue messed my day up to be honest but I'm not going to focus on that, Vue is a necessary evil to help me in the future

And I'm testing his website and omg on the discord today, I just realized how jellyfishes are, okay so sea anemones or urchins I think are essentially immortal, like what da butt, they also look like corals which are animals, surprise surprise. Okay so jellyfishes don't have a brain, heart, ear or nose like what da flip, and they can still sense predators and how do they know who their sperm is going to when they reproduce sexually, so confusing this world is 😂

    Entry: I started out in the WORST mood ever, so irritated and not enough time or energy to deal with anyone's shit lol, then I took a cold bath ish and listened to some music which made things better, then I relaxed for a bit and continued my precioso pelicula de Gran hotel :), well it isn't a movie but wuteva, then I chatted with the discord group for a while and I was blushing cuz I feel like Gilbert's speciality is in animals while mine is in knowing ecologically or environmentally about the environment in hypothetical situations which doesn't make sense but it still made me blush :). Then for the rest of today, ive just being binge watching lilly Singh and she's the best thing that has happened to me this week🤣🤣, she's super hilarious and I've been laughing like a maniac lol, I also had a dream about an eclipse when there was an actual eclipse... coincidence..I think not!, Okay and I feel nervous about the internship tomorrow which is weird but not because I have to turn on my camera and I know worrying will make it worse but I'm not really worrying it's more like my brain trying to imagine every wrong scenario by a thin thread of me blocking it lol, also I have to acknowledge Vue that I'm not slaving over it anymore which is super good for me. tomorrow's internship will be good so stop overthinking things, text Richard on slack.  Right now...and tell him that I don't have the link. Yeah that's what was mostly on my mind, you know what, I'm texting him now..I also should thank him for the loan cuz I feel super disrepectful but bleh he's probably not thinking about me.  DONE, hopefully he texts back quick, I'm gonna continue watching lilly now, ciao

Gilbert and crab dude showed me their super cute pets, crab dude had his dog for 10 years...woah, I'm kind of mad I don't have a pet lol. I also feel like someone hacked my phone but I don't really care, I've also been trying to find volunteer opportunities for my resume but haven't found any, my mum just annoyed me but I'm gonna ignore her like usual lol, I also realize how much willdife and nature I've missed out on because I didn't notice them like the vicsum farm, like so much creatures that I didn't know about. I'm also doing a boxing workout on Monday to switch things up lol

I was going through his photos ( I'm not a stalker lol ) maybe I am :), ew creepy, and he has some...questionable photos...I'm just gonna take my mind off it...ew.... Kristina's discord was sooooo funnn, I learnt that crocodiles can gallop🤣🤣 and one of them lives close to me, in Detroit too. They're almost my age and Gilbert loves reptiles lol, I just started reading this bird book and also started mine..yay but birds are really fascinating creatures, I'm still torn between all of them lol but I'm getting to like birds. Ew the image is still in my mind, ew🥴🥴🤢🤢🤮, like ew, He literally has videos...of himself ..and his gf ...and him smoking....LIKE WHODAFLUP does that, tbh I don't really care about the smoking, giraffe and his friends smoke and it's NBD but having pictures and acting like it's cool like omg, people like those are ew, that's why I love Kristina's discord, also did yoga today :) and ew oml, this is why my classmates annoy me, it's like I knew not really but yeah that he was gonna be one of those kind of people, buying Nikes and shorts and ew, I'm just gonna log out...or should I...yes ..ew.  To be honest I'm not even shocked or disgusted anymore, it's a free world and if he wants to have pictures of whatever he does it's his life and I have no right to judge him or the other people doing whatever stuff they do and have pictures of it

    Entry: Had a super fun chat with the people in Kristina's discord and learnt that cetaceans are whales/porpoises, I also learnt THAT PORPOISES ARE LIKE WHALES, like I didn't know what they looked like before but it was nothing like I imagine. It was really fun lol. I'm also stuck between learning about deep ocean creatures or mammals or birds, they are all so fascinating and I wanna study them all lol, I also want to start a bird book with a list of birds and their drawings which will be ordered alphabetically and it'll help me learn birds. My favorite reptile now is a Alligator snapping turtle whichs name I always have to think a second before I remember lol. My mum just came up with a perfect and beautifully sustainable idea of using a plastic bag as dustbin WHEN THERE'S A FREAKING DUSTBIN THERE AND MAGGOTS ARE FROM THE FLIPPING FLIES, it's like she's so uneducated environmental wise but I didn't mention anything because I ain't got time for her useless shouting where she only wants to hear herself so I'll just leave them to it. I'm trying to become as sustainable as possible, seeing so many endangered species struggling because of human activities. Hopefully people will change their ways, till then, I'm doing what I can to do my part ( spreading knowledge and trying to reduce my carbon footprint ) STARTING FROM NOT CHARGING MY PHONE OVERNIGHT which is a pretty dumb thing I've been doing knowing very well that I'm wasting energy, I might not understand the physics behind it but I know why I'm doing it, also turning off lights when they aren't needed ( maybe my parents should be reading this lol ) cuz they just turn on lights like it's a Christmas party. Another thing, for the slides today, I think we killed it and it looks super awesome, anyways, fak I forgot what I was gonna say uhh, I finished Duolingo sets, uhh, I had a good workout UHH I can't remember, UGHHHHH FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK,

    Entry: Listened to a lot of good music today and danced like an idiot lol, one it stuck in my head. Today was an overall good day, I feel myself wanting to get sucked into the worrying hands of Vue but I'm trying to stay away from that. I'm also thinking about writing another book about the diary of a serial killer lol, it's getting dark up in here. And lastly, IM IN KRISTINAS DISCORD WOOP WOOPA, Kristina lynn that is, she made it open and I was trying to make it work but it wasn't and got super annoyed but used my brain to make it work cuz I WONT GIVE UP lol😁. Anyways that's basically eat, didn't eat a lot of macaroni and tried to eat healthy even though I'm sure that I shouldn't be eating the pepper because of the sugar content. Also I heard that my brother from him calling tomiwa that he was reading a book on law which was super weird but Rn I don't care, just felt like I should add that lol AND I WENT TO SCHOOL AND SAW MRS TILLMAN, MCDONALD AND THE PRINCIPAL lol idk why I'm shouting, Mr Sewell said I grew tall lol 😊. I also got the school laptop which is like a tab that converts into a computer but the specs aren't that impressive but Im so lucky to have this opportunity and I should be a bitxh about it. I also should be brushing Rn lol. I just need to check myself with the Vue stuff. Okay so basically when I see something related to Vue, I start to get really worked up on forgetting things that I've learnt and then I end up going on this rabbit hole to try to remember everything I learnt in Vue which is pretty annoying and I don't like how it feels so I distanced myself from Vue and it worked for a while but I can't keep running away from it. However I think a good way to handle it would be to know that Vue isn't like a serial killer lol and it's okay to forget stuff or not know stuff and I should be happy with what I know. Steve and Daniel were not sure on how to do the guarded navigations and as they say, Google is your best friend so I'm going to keep that in mind, I should probably also write this in my always on display so when I feel overwhelmed I'll come back to it. IT'S OKAY TO FORGET STUFF OR NOT KNOW STUFD. I'll have to get that engrained in my head or as a tattoo lol. I think it's because of all the expectations that Daniel has for me with learning Vue and being the youngest Vue developer in Detroit or Michigan or something like that but if I start to get overwhelmed Everytime I'm around Vue then it probably no, not probably, it's best for me to take care of my mental health ( I did yoga today lol ) and I should realize that it isn't about knowing everything or being a jack of all trades, it's about being good enough to call yourself a developer but not being so overcompulsive on the Vue learning that it gives you a weird feeling when you see the Vue logo, I'm gonna engrain this in my always on display lol. ITS OKAY TO FORGET OR NOT KNOW SOMETHING. This just took a whole lot of load from my poor heart lol. I'm going to brush my teeth now...toodles. ONE last thing. IM ABOUT TO REACH A FREAKING MILLION VIEWS ON QUORA :0000000000, Just felt like I should say that :)

I'm wearing shorts which are super hot lol but stretchy, I didn't do my normal workout, I did one of athleans x workout that was short but super hard and my right back ish is like torn out. I fasted for like 18 to 19 hours which was to 5 o'clock, I probably did longer but I'm gonna be lenient with it. Today was overall an awesome day, also the roof was completely removed on the open part for it to dry. Can't wait for romorrow

Then it all worked out happily, it also happened Michigan which is super awesome. Another thing, I just resisted the temptation from two things, overeating rice and jerking off. I was about to but I didn't feel like it, I felt such an energy rush today, I'm leaning back from Vue this week and maybe next week. I've also been looking very very vascular, my veins are even showing now. Mrs Yates also gave a link to a nat Geo page where they do live streams which is SUPER awesome and I wouldn't have known about it before. I'm gonna watch some YouTube videos in the room now. Feeling really happy, byee

Honestly he dug his ditch and that's his fault. We have to wait for Monday 😠 before he sends someone. The air in the room is also grainy and I'm thinking of sleeping in the sitting room XD.

I feel like I've gained weight, not a lot but weight nonetheless and not a lot of muscle is that makes sense, it might just be in my head but I really believe it :(. I also didn't resist temptation today :( and I didn't have a call for my job today. I just realized that all my content ( questions and answers ) have reached 1 MILLION VIEWS :)) but I want only my answers to reach 1 million 😁😁, I'm at 800k right now.

I'm not feeling very Vue because I've just been going over the parts for like 30 seconds, I'm feeling very Vue blocked all over again. The thought of it is even exhausting.

Omg this just reinforces what I was talking about, Everytime I stress, something completely unexpected happens that totally throws me off track, in addition to worrying is useless, I'm gonna start saying that worrying will just cause sth unexpected that'll mess everything up when I start worrying.

I resisted temptation, did a lot of productive stuff today and my hand has been feeling weird but I don't wanna acknowledge it, also my screen on the edges are acting color weird showing green where there's white so that's that, and I'm learning about class bindings which is almost the same as style bindings except they refer to class while styles are for specific styles lol, they're called by doing :style="{mystyle}" and setting an object like css blah blah blah time for quora, also now I'm seriously thinking of starting a garden cuz Kristina posted a video of her garden update and it's just magestic...so yeah, see you later

Ughh and it was so confusing to understand what was happening with the dates and stuff but I have a little of things clarified. It's Soo annoying when people don't respond to my emails about the things quickly, it just annoys the heck outta me, they can have at least 5 minutes but I don't know their life so I'm not gonna judge, axel finally answered me, serenity didn't, it's their problem tbh, I'm just tired. I don't even knows when the next meeting is, but I know everything would work itself out and there's no point in worrying because it's useless and won't change the outcome of anything ever. I also talked to giraffe today and calling him giraffe is weird lol, honey badger would be better haha, I miss savy tbh, hb at least made it better for me ( my confusion ), I'm just gonna lay low for a while and see how things are to be done before picking things up. I can't wait for Wednesday tho..see you soon

Then, things were mundane for a while, until class started, we finally have access to the app and we had to test the test cases, do journals, do a lot ish of stuff and I finished most of it today in just 2 hours and the ones I didn't finish was because I didn't have access but I've emailed Eddie, I'm still gonna be testing the app and looking for bugs hehe. Today was super great, made me feel like a real developer lol. And I got my writing groove back...I'm so much like Jane Villanueva 🤣🤣, I feel like I feel better when things are structured and I have a plan, like today, if I didn't everything would've been chaos. Or in the words of apple and onion....Take it one step at a time 🎼🎼and you'll find yourrr wayyyy

    Entry: My mum says the stupidest things, it's like...soooo dumb. Let's start from the top, my brother did whatever he did and the RACK fell, so my mum got home with her negativity and he was like - I didn't want to pick it up because he said that I should pick it up -, soooo she called me, saying that why didn't I pick up the hanger, which was so confusing with a normal hanger, so I was like are you talking about the rack and she got angry saying whatever she was saying cuz I just tuned her out, then she was like, why didn't you want to pick it up, so I wanted to say that if I didn't have anything to do with sth, and he expects me to pick it up, then since I'm older than my younger brother, I should THEN be able to tell him to pick it up, but noooo, she only wants to hear her dumb, irrational self talk, and then she was acting like she was saying something smart, it was even funny because I didn't want to laugh because I am taller than her and she's threatening me, it's just so stupid, I went back to the room and put in my headphones. It's days like this that makes me think what goes on in her head, she only wants to hear herself talk Everytime, my respect for her just dwindles every time, luckily she's staying at work on Friday...oh I wish she would just stay there and come like once a week, she's sooooo irrational and self absorbed and I don't think she ever hears what she's saying. Sometimes I just feel like shouting at her and grabbing her by the shoulders, making her feel weak and think about every word that comes out of her mouth.... P.s the reason I'm writing this is that I don't wanna build up that anger that she always brings, like Mrs Yates - someone that actually cares and listens to another person's point of view - said that it can build up and erupt so I'm letting it all out

I got another document for the internship, a easier one but I need a ssn and I don't have one, I'm not really angry that I don't have one, I'm just happy to have the opportunity to get those kind of internships, I don't know if I should put 00000 on it 😅, ttyl

    Entry: Today started out kinda badly, I overslept and missed first hour by 14 minutes, i was a little angry cuz my younger brother was awake and in class but it isn't his duty to wake me up. Then I worked out and it wasn't a good workout, I'm gonna redesign it today. After all that, for the JOURNi job and Microsoft internship, I had to fill in the form and stuff for it and for the JOURNi one, it's really confusing but I asked Kamila but she hasn't gotten back to me yet, we have a call on June 15 from 1-3, so I'll ask there. I also have a JOURNi account now which is super cool. I'm feeling really unproductive and I deleted the last two chapters of my book to stick with the plan cuz I'm running low on motivation and I wanted to quit writing the book but I'm not gonna quit, another thing, Erin and johnie better start reaching out before class is close cuz it's super annoying to have to explain stuff to them like 5 hours before class. Mrs Shatica also reached back to me and I'm really happy bout that, I'm gonna update my journals now, ciao

    Entry: I overslept a little today lol, woke up at 9:40, I was also productive today, I'm still reading blink and what I read blew my mind, being taller can mean that unconsciously, you can get more money than people who are shorter and black people are unconsciously and sometimes consciously easier associated with danger than whites which is crazy and dad. Something smells so bad in the room...ew. I also got really inspired seeing the amount of black Wildlife biologists on Instagram ( I instantly followed lol ) and I'm now more motivated, I should also stop being scared to post environmental facts on the internet despite all that's happening now. I also wanna start looking for ways to volunteer to get some experience and be sure that that's what I wanna do, good luck to me then

    Entry: Mrs Yates is the best teacher ever, I just want to say that. Since I don't wanna talk about my mental health, I have to talk about it. Right now, I feel scared about what Mrs Yates said that anything can happen in school which made me think of all the things that could happen, and also 2020 has been a very crazy year, coronavirus, riots, Australian fire, so much has happened and it's just June, but I know things are going to get better, everything can't remain bad forever and for every bad, there's a good. Like for the civil war, there has to be -violence- for something to change. And I think this year would be a start of something new, a new decade and a new world. Like new laws for black people safety and safer ways to protect us from a new outbreak, maybe it'll also make people care about the environment more. I feel better now and working out is helping my mental health too, combined with yoga, I'm for sure going to do restorative yoga tomirrow. Things are going to get better

    Entry: Okay so just finished class - internship which was kind of fun but they talked about what's happening with George Floyd and the way my opinion changes baffle me lol. At first I thought peaceful protests were better I still do kind of but sometimes violence might be the answer to actually shake things up. Enough about that, I'm not really involving myself in this because my opinion might not matter and I don't know why I think like this, maybe it's because I haven't witnessed or being a victim of police brutality and maybe that's why but I don't wanna stress myself with this stuff. anyways SpaceX launched a rocket to space today 🚀 which is really monumental lol but there was a brief moment when they lost connection and it was like poof, the rocket was landed which conspiracy theorist would love like me sometimes, I also chatted with giraffe and his friend today and it was really cool to catch up with them. Funny thing, axel said he asked his family if they needed money and Mrs Gale was like he was really kind which annoyed me because my dumb self is jealous of someone's kindness, maybe I should be kind myself, There are a lot of people wayy kinder than me and a lot meaner than me. Maybe it was how I was raised, which wasn't really to be nice or be not nice particularly but I'm not gonna consume myself over someone else's life, the way I disliked him when I started getting to know him was shocking lol

    Entry: Today feels like a deja vu, rant incoming....okay so I think today or yesterday, police officers killed a black man without any reason, or none that I'm sure of, I'm not going to judge anyone yet until I know the full story, the video does although show what the police officer did which isn't good in the slightest, maybe the police officers were wrong but other police officers shouldn't be blamed for this, there are over 700,000 police officers in the US and because 4 of them decided to be racist doesn't make all the 699,996 racist too, it doesn't make sense, they should be protesting against the officers that did it and not harassing normal, non racist - I hope - officers. Another thing is that black people kill each other all the time, it's the sad truth and I know it's wrong to be saying this and I shouldn't be saying it but what makes this different, I kind of know because they're white and POLICE OFFICERS who are supposed to protect people so scratch that, I understand now, all I'm saying is...all police officers shouldn't be harassed for something 4 police officers did, it kind of makes some black people hypocrites saying that not every African American man is dangerous. His death is really sad tho and I don't think anyone should die like that....okay, away from the rant, I think I'm beginning to grasp vuex, okay so vuex creates a store - the way I switched topics😅, as I was saying, vuex creates like a store, a really store where components ( like people ) can go to the store and get things ( which would be the state ), then mutations are used to change the state ( like workers restocking ) while the actions commit the mutations ( like invoicing what was restocked ). This is initialized in the state...blach blah it's late and I wanna sleep. Btw the internship group hasn't met in like 2 weeks which is really weird but today is Mrs Gale's birthday..yay for her...gonna sleep now, it's late and hot but there's the fan

    Entry: Weirdest dream ever, I went to a totally different planet to save Emma Watson from these evil people, one of them was an old lady who we defeated, we then ran away and ended up in a monastery but they followed us, I think it was a monastery, there was a fountain in the center, a portal and a pink, creeping flower, there were also different stones so we started fighting them again and we managed to throw them into the portal, then Emma Watson showed me some rocks and asked me which one to throw and I don't remember the names but she threw one in and the portal closed luckily, then I asked her to read my book on wattpad 😂 and she pulled it up with a tech like the toothpaste squeezer I was watching yesterday, but in a book form, she didn't finish it but I didn't care, because we were datingggg, then with the help of someone or something helped us escape in a portal, then on our way to earth, I think I said I can't wait to see my babe on earth or something cringy like that and Emma was like I have to choose between either of them, smartly, I chose my earth "babe"😂😂 , then I got to earth and on my way to class, the hallways were crazy, like before in mrs Stewart's class that she closed the door but I pushed through, I even heard someone call it the no man's land. Then after all that, the teacher started talking about phyelement and social distancing that if we want to "fuxk" someone, you should fuxk the floor which was crazy, then I pulled out my laptop to watch a thomas delauer video and I ended up on a video of him...🍾 which went to his face and he ate it 🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐, I'm not lying, then another video where he was on the edge and someone did one stroke and 🍾🍾🍾🍾, everywhere, oh my lord.

    Entry: Feeling good after the shower, I also feel so swol,  I look so swol 😎✊, okay so for tomorrow, first wake up, then do basic things and when I get to school, first hour is practice but I'm going to go for journi, and then second hour, I would leave and go for practice. Third hour, I go to mr Gs class, and then for lunch, I'll check the gym ( I might take meat pie with me to eat post workout ) and if the gym is closed, I'll either look for mr Floyd and ask him to open it or I'll just come after school, crossed fingers that the coach isnt there...also, after school is over, I workout if I couldnt at lunch, and then I go for practice..I wouldn't go for robotics cuz of the practice... and then after it's over, Richard would take me to the pistons thing from school..i have to tell him tomorrow that he can pick me..its at 5:15 so after practice...and then stay till 9:30 and when I'm done..home sweet home

    Entry: Today was weird, first I had a dream that It was a really really dark night and I was outside of central, i felt scared like actually scared in a dream and then I told david that he can come to where I live, then we were walking, then at the plants side, I didnt see him again but then I spotted him on the other side and I went to the house with him, and then I think my dad was at the door but I wasnt sure...then I had another dream about a maggot and me and a bunch of people were fighting other people for this maggot, then it went on the floor and we were looking for it..eventually I found it and hid it..weird dream....then I woke up feeling tired but it was 7:00 and I went to bath, then I didnt resist temptation.....doh...but I went for academic games by 8:15, I didnt win any game per se - long story - and then I asked mrs Fisher to drop me off at the robotics place..she said she's going to get me Bucharest on Thursday 3rd hour..I need to remind her..going to do that after this...then i surprised my teammates and they were really happy to see me..i did some programming and learned a lot .I'm so happy Daniel didnt get angry,  I'm for sure going there next week...and then I'm here in the bus now after a relaxing day..but my mum is coming today so she's guaranteed to fuck it up but she cant mess it up if I'm watching Netflix all day 😎😎..I also didnt get a chance to workout yesterday kind of...the gym was closed so I worked on my bodyweight exercises..bye for now

    Entry: Today I had a weird dream, it was like I killed someone from the magicians and there was a bounty on my head, then I was on a chopper and landed close to a farm truck but directly near it was a Lamborghini I think..I'm not good with cars lol.. and then i got into it and saw three women in white and black and one was holding a baseball bat then I ran one over..dang, so dark...and then i magically ended up at school and i was going up the stairs and I saw Mr Green and he was like he could turn me over to the cops or whatever it was but he didn't and then I dont remember what happened after that..and then again I had a dream about what happened last night..so basically I have a tablet from school that has unlimited wifi and my dad wants to use it for his college work, my brother then uses it as an opportunity to use my wifi..so then in the dream, I first got them to connect to the wifi and then I took a pic of the MAC address for their phones and then I put it on allowed devices and then I named the devices so it can only work for his laptop and then, can only do work..so petty😅😅.. anyways, today started out pretty good and then school was over and the weight room door was closed..luckily the robotics bus hadn't come yet and I was waiting and waiting and the door finally opened and I proceeded with my workout WITHOUT THE COACH...yass..I was so happy, I progressed in all my lifts and my chest feels blasted from the bench press lol, I have to work on my rows tho..now I'm on the bus for robotics..today was a really good way...I also started the mindfulness book and I've learned that mindlessness can come from anything..from context to repetition to premature cognitive commitment or something like that which is like setting boundaries for yourself..see you later

    Entry: Today has been awesome so far, my schedule - I feel old lol, was filled up, lemme explain, so first, I had to drop off my younger brother and he was walking slowly, but at least we made it home around 3:27, then as I was waiting to cross, THE ABANDONED BUILDING CLOSE TO MY APARTMENT COLLAPSED, it like collapsed on its own and it made a lot of noise,honestly I was scared, thank God no one got hurt, and then I got to school by running and then it was around 3:35 before I started lifting, I lifted 100lbs on the squat today..period, and then I lifted 45lbs on the overhead press and it wasn't as challenging as last time and then the bus came so I wasn't sure whether I could do the deadlifts so I rushed over to it and luckily, it was only one set for the deadlift so I kicked that outta the way and rushed to the bus..my trouser is kinda dirty...doh...anyways, I'm off to robotics

    Entry: Just finished working out.. oo it was tough, out of breath lol..I'm still resisting temptation so far, theres no school tomorrow so I wouldn't be able to lift, that's why I worked out today, then on tuesday, I'll lift but not push myself so far to be sore, and then Wednesday too, I'll lift heavy and then again on friday, hopefully that plan would work, we didnt go to church today cuz the car wasn't starting and the weird thing was that I had like a feeling that something bad might happen on the road and then I prayed in the shower and the car didnt work...hallelujah

    Entry: So today I lifted, yayyyyy, I feel like I got stronger in the squats but a little bit weaker in the bench press, I need to find out the weight of the bar but I'm using 20 so that means I lifted 70lbs on the squat and I'm lifting 75 next time. On the bench press I lifted 50lbs, I think it was because it was incline that I did worse but I'll research that but on the barbell row I did great but with room of improvement with 75 + the weight of the bar but I'm not so sure of that. I'm so happy that I lifted and im gonna make sure I stay motivated to lift weights  my next target on the squats is ( I also used the free weights...yay, I think that's what made me lift a little less but with more bodily reactions cuz my legs are freaking sore lol, wait till tomorrow and I'll know what sore is) 75 with 2.5lbs increase on both side, I also need to add the stress on my  body for the hormeic response, I have the overheard press which isnt gonna be easy but what's good doesnt come easy, I think I'll lift 50lbs on that one but it depends on what's light,  and for the deadlift, itll be 75+weight of the bar, I would also do a 15 minute cardio if I have time cuz I have robotics, I'm feeling so accomplished oh and robotics is now at 4:30 after today so yay, and I think that's it, I took inventory for robotics today and feeling really really accomplished, I'm gonna make a sketch now on the plan, goodbye

    Entry: Okay so, when I used to ask my mum to recycle , she said she doesnt have the time to do it, but when she saw that she could earn money from recycling metal, that's when time suddenly poofed into her and she's been recycling metal just for the money, I understand that she needs the money but she should at least have the decency to care for the environment, and now that they bring home plastic bottles, ( idea - a pickup service that instead of picking up trash, picks up plastics, metal and paper to recycle ), lota of plastic bottles, I asked her to recycle and guess what, she said that they dont pay money for recycling it and she doesnt want to recycle it, that's just how messed up she is, in fact, my family is because it's like they dont care about the environment, heck my dad works in a slaughterhouse, A FUCKING SLAUGHTERHOUSE, good luck to me trying to become vegan, and then the fires in Australia, I love Kristina because she genuinely cares about the environment and I want to be like her, I pray for the firefighters and everyone in Australia witnessing the fires, I hope we can stop global warming before it's too late and I have to try harder to help, I think I'm doing a good job unplugging unused cables and trying to raise awareness, I'm also helping by signing petitions but I just dont think it's enough, I have to think harder, goodbye for now
